# Stream Host

A Stream Host is an application that can either be installed as a Windows Service or as a Console Application. Stream Hosts enable Data Streams to run and execute actions and are also responsible for getting the configurations of [Non-Virtual Agents](../concepts/agent/virtual-vs-non-virtual-agents.md#non-virtual-agents).

## How to Override Variables

Although each Stream Host in a given Collection downloads the same definition of a Data Stream, the [Variables](manage-variables.md) defined in Data Stream Designer can be overridden by the individual Stream Host to provide the unique configuration per Asset e.g. OPC IP Address.

To override variables for a Stream Host, see the following options

* [Using Environment variables](stream-host.md#using-environment-variables)
* [Using Variables.xv file](stream-host.md#using-variables.xv-file)

### Using Environment variables

This option can be applied to any Stream Host install scenario, although it is better suited for when running [Stream Host on Docker](../installation/3.-complete-installation/install-stream-host/docker.md).

Create an environment variable that is applied to a running Stream Host instance, prefixing the name of the variable that should be overridden with `xmservervariable__`

```
xmservervariable__NameOfVariable1=foo
xmservervariable__NameOfVariable2=bar
xmservervariable__NameOfVariable3=noop
```

### Using Variables.xv file

{% hint style="info" %}
This option is not supported when running Stream Host on Docker.
{% endhint %}

1. Open the Collection page.
2. Select the Collection.
3. Hover on More.
4. Click Variables.
5. Click Select file and upload the encrypted variables.xv file, found in the Data folder of the Stream Host's installation directory e.g. "_C:\Program Files\XMPro Stream Host\Data_".
6. You can enter overrides for any Variables.
7. Click Download to get the updated file.
8. Replace the original file in your Stream Host folder with the new one.
9. Restart your Stream Host to load the updated variables.
