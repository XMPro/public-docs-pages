# Data Stream

A Data Stream is a visual display of data flow, letting you integrate and connect various systems or data sources to view your information. This includes real-time data from machines, websites, or other streaming sources, as well as contextual data like an item's make or model.

The Data Stream Designer lets you see all connected data in one place and manipulate it in different ways, such as aggregating, filtering, displaying, or saving to another database. You can monitor data to spot critical events like machine failures, without needing coding skills.

Data Stream's flow is represented by agents connected by arrows, enabling data processing at each agent based on its function, allowing you to view and perform actions on data from multiple sources in one place.

## Finding Data Streams

Use the search bar to find specific Data Streams, and select from the dropdown menu to search either throughout Data Stream Designer or only for Data Streams.

![Fig 1. Ways to Find Data Streams](<../../.gitbook/assets/DS - Search Data Streams.png>)

## Data Stream Type

The Type selected in the Properties affects your choice of how often and when polling-based Agents run.

**Streaming (Default)**: This allows you to specify a Polling Interval in seconds on polling-based Agents in the Stream Object configuration. Polling starts immediately and continues indefinitely.

**Recurring**: This allows you to specify granular options to schedule polling-based Agents in the Stream Object configuration. Options allow you to control the start time, repetition interval, and end time or number of repetitions. There is also the option to repeat indefinitely.

## Buffer Size

An advanced option in Data Stream enables compensation for large event sizes, high event numbers, or increased stream complexity by allocating more memory. The default buffer size is 128kb.

## The Canvas

Data streams are crafted in an interactive canvas, allowing you to drag agents from the toolbox to the drawing area. In the same environment, configure agent settings, manage versions, define business cases, and more.&#x20;

Stream Objects on the canvas can be duplicated or deleted, and for easy identification and access, they're marked with a unique color and abbreviation.

## The Toolbox

The toolbox is a component in the Data Stream Designer that allows you to choose an Agent from a library of Agents that have been uploaded to the system and drag the agent from the toolbox to the Canvas when building a stream. All agents in the toolbox will always be the latest version and will all be available for all users, regardless of their role, unless a user does not have permission to view any of the Agents.&#x20;

Agents are grouped by category in the toolbox. To expand a category, click on the arrow next to the category name. Please note that if no agents in a particular category are uploaded, the entire category will be hidden. Thus, if you are missing some of the categories in the toolbox, it is likely that there aren’t any Agents uploaded belonging to that category.
