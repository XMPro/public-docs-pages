# Alert Triage

The Alert Triage is an area that provides useful information on suggested actions to resolve the Alert, and links to relevant resources.&#x20;

It is only available if the Recommendation Rule has [Triage Instructions](../../concepts/recommendation/rule.md#triage-instructions) enabled.&#x20;
