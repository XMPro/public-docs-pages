# Unity

The Unity Block can display data that is received via the Data Source and it is interactive by configuring the [Action ](../common-properties.md#action)on the Button or any other component that has that option to update the Data Source.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
This Block only supports Unity **2020 and above** and Unity WebGL content is not currently supported on **mobile devices**.&#x20;

For Unity 2019 use the [Unity (Legacy)](unity-1.md) Block.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Disable Keyboard Capture**\
Is your keyboard non-responsive once a Unity model is loaded? Follow [this guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/WebGLInput-captureAllKeyboardInput.html) to prevent the keyboard input from being locked to the Unity model.
{% endhint %}
