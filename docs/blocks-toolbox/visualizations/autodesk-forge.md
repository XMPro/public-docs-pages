# Autodesk Forge

The Autodesk Forge Block integrates Autodesk Forge into the page. Autodesk Forge is a platform that offers APIs that allow you to access engineering data and designs from the cloud. Some APIs allow you to embed 2D or 3D views of your design into a webpage. The Autodesk Construction Cloud platform (ACC) is another feature that allows the user to construct new engineering designs using web apps. For more details, visit the [official Autodesk Forge website](https://forge.autodesk.com/).&#x20;
