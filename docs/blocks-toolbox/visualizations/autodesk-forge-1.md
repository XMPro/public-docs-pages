# Live Feed

The Live Feed Block is a dynamic visualization block that allows users to incorporate their own IP Live Feed camera into an application. This block provides real-time visual insights directly within the app interface.&#x20;

By integrating a live feed, users can monitor events as they unfold in real-time. When used in conjunction with other blocks within App Designer, it allows users to not only view real-time events but also to monitor and visualize key statistics related to the area under surveillance. This combination of live visuals and data-driven insights provides a comprehensive overview of the situation, enabling users to respond more effectively to changing conditions.

The controls at runtime will depend on the camera software used.

## Live Feed Properties

### Appearance

#### Common Properties

The _visibility_ property is common to most Blocks;

[See the Common Properties article for more details on common appearance properties.](../common-properties.md#appearance)

### Behavior

#### Live Feed URL&#x20;

Enter the URL of the IP live camera. The contents of the feed will load automatically from this URL.

{% hint style="info" %}
The live feed will be streamed on the canvas once the URL has been provided.
{% endhint %}

#### Enable Scrollbars&#x20;

The live video feed is confined by the block's dimensions on the canvas. Enabling the "Enable Scrollbars" option removes these limitations, displaying the video feed at its original size.&#x20;

If the native size exceeds the block dimensions, users can use scroll bars to help navigate.
