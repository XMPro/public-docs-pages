Follow the instructions in the [Install Stream Host](./) guide to download the connection profile and installer.

**Hardware and Software**

Refer to the [**hardware** requirements](../../../../installation/install.md#hardware-requirements) and the [**software** requirements](../../../../installation/install.md#software-requirements) in the **1. Preparation** guide.

#### **Software Install Commands**&#x20;

Install required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y wget liblttng-ust0 libkrb5-3 zlib1g uuid-runtime systemd 

# Install Dotnet Runtime
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb

## Install

When you are ready, you may install the Stream Host by using the following command:

_`sudo dpkg -i /home/adminuser/xmpro-stream-host.deb`_

During the installation process, you will be asked a few questions:

*   “_Enter a Friendly Name for this Stream Host_”

    This is the name that appears when you view the Stream Hosts online.
*   “_Enter Server Url to connect to_”

    This is the server where Data Stream Designer is hosted, for example: “_https://mysampleserver/datastreamdesigner/_“. Please note that this URL needs to end in a forward slash.
*   “_Enter Collection Id_”

    This is the ID of your Collection and can be copied from Data Stream Designer.
*   “_Enter collection secret Key_”

    This is the secret key of your Collection and can be copied from Data Stream Designer.
*   “_Enter encryption key_”

    This is the key that the Stream Host will use to encrypt or decrypt secure [user settings](https://docs.xmpro.com/docs/data-stream-designer/concepts/agents/#agent-components), for example, a SQL Server password.

These settings can be found in Data Stream Designer:

## Uninstall

_`sudo dpkg -r xmpro-stream-host`_

The Stream Host will then be removed. Some files, such as logs, may not be removed because they were created after the installation.
