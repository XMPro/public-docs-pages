in this video i will demonstrate the

versioning feature of recommendations

to view your versions navigate to more

and versions on a recommendation if you

click that you'll see a blade

show up here and you're able to click on

a version and you can copy it

you can view it or there's more than one

version available you can delete

so let's demonstrate a copy here then we

will

view version 2.0

we can see that this version is not

published

so let's publish it once it's published

we can go back to versions

we can see that there's now version 2.0

is published

another thing we can do we can go back

to 1.0

only one version is able to be published

at any given moment

so to know about version 2.0 is

published you can see there's an

unpublished

option there so if we publish version

1.1 here

now version 1.1 is published version 2.2

is now unpublished

you can do anything that happens in a

version

we'll stick to that version you can

change the data stream you can add rules

you can delete rules

the only caveat to versioning is that

the only thing that does not change

with versions is the name
