video from XM pro today we will be

looking at how to use the scroll box

component the scroll box component is a

box that will create scroll bars if the

contents are larger than it in order for

the scroll box to work properly the

containing element must not have a

display value of Flex I'm going to put

some contents in this scroll box and

then duplicate this until until it's

larger than the scroll box the scroll

box doesn't show up in the designer and

any elements that are inside the scroll

box will overflow but when you view it

from the renderer the scroll box will

display correctly

there are some properties we can make

use of on the scroll box direction which

comes with vertical horizontal or both

vertical means that if the content goes

if the content overflows vertically it

will create a scrollbar like this

horizontal means that if the content

overflows horizontally it will create a

scrollbar but not vertically

and both means that this would will

happen horizontally or vertically so I

have to scroll if this is checked then

you'll be able to scroll with a mouse

click and drag or with a finger if

you're on a touchscreen device click and

drag this has been how to use the scroll

box component
