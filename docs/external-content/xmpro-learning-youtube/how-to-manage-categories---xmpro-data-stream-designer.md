XM Pro today we will be looking at how

to manage categories if you look at the

first landing screen on the data stream

designer you can see the title of the

page says categories so you are looking

at some categories down here like

equipment maintenance and asset

performance monitoring these categories

are shared between all the products like

create categories based on their
