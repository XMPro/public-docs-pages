welcome to another training video from

exam pro

today we'll be looking at how to allow

chart printing or exporting

in app design

over here i already create two charts

which are reading values from a sql data

source to enable

clean or export for a chart

you can go to the active mode

select the chart that you want to enable

the feature

expand parents

scroll down until you see allow print

export

for demo purposes i will enable one for

one chart for export another chart for

playing

now we're going to see the changes

the print and allow buttons already show

on the top right hand corner of the

chart

when you click on the export button

the chart will be exported to png format

or if you click on the print button and

print dialog will be displayed
