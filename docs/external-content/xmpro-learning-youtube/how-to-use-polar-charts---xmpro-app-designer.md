in this video we will be going over how

to configure a polar chart

i have already dragged the preconfigured

polar chart to the canvas

we'll go over the configuration

properties here

first off we have the visibility setting

we can set it to true or false

we have a spider web setting this will

set rather the

power chart should be a flat circle it

looks like a spider web start

angle is how rotated the polar chart is

so first off let's view the power chart

as it currently is

we can see that the axis right here

is lined up with the zero degree when we

go back into it and we

look at the start angle now let's move

this over to

20 degrees save this we'll look at this

in the viewer we can see that the axis

has been

moved 20 degrees over the tick interval

is

the lines generated between each value

if there is a date time you can set the

accepted

hours minutes months quarters things

like that

if you have a number you can set a sp

specified value

god damn it the tick interval is how the

sections are divided on the polar chart

in this case we're using a string so

it's split

by uh by a name value the argument line

color is the color of the

tick intervals label here the display

grid line

option here allows you to display the

grid lines between

each numerical value that we were

displaying and the color of that grid

line

the labels are the labels of the tick

interval here

we can choose between between label and

cross labels between label

display on the line itself cross labels

but displays it in the area that it

represents

we have a legend as well we have an

option that legend is visible

and where it can be on the chart itself

the data source is a typical data source

and all other controls

you bind into a data and you're able to

filter it and sort it

as you see fit then we have the data

itself

within the data i currently created a

health series

we have the name of our series here

we want it to be visible and show in the

legend

you can set the color for your series in

this case it's green

and the type of series you want to show

in this case is going to be a bar graph

then we have argument field for the name

this is

this is what our tick interval is based

off of and then we have our value field

which is the actual value we are

displaying on the chart

there's an option to ignore empty points

if that's needed

and you have and you can show points at

the size font that you

like lastly we have a label format so in

this case we're going to display it as a

large number because many options here

that you can choose from and this is our

final result right here
