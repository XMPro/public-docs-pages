as AI scales within the organization

corporate guard rails require AI to be

modeled within an mlops framework you

don't want to end up with models stored

in a variety of places and lose track of

which is the latest version or where it

is

located ml flow agent is the first in a

series that enables effective model

governance using a popular mlops tool

set let us know if you are using a

different

repository this empowers data scientists

to promote new model versions within MLF

flow without going back to edit the data

stream let's see this in

action my thanks to Chris for recording

this

demo as soon as I find my

mouse in it we have an mlflow agent

configured to use version one

of a model called wine

quality once the data stream is

published observe that the first event

confirms model version one was used to

make a

prediction now we'll change over to

mlflow and promote version two to

production

going back to the data stream without

reconfiguring or republishing observe

that model version 2 is seamlessly used

to make the next

prediction
