the text block is one of the basic

controls in an application it can be

used as a header a label the descriptive

sentence of a short paragraph or even to

display dynamic data to begin locate the

text block in the blocks tab and drag it

onto the page in fact we have one here

already it can be edited by double

clicking it or by opening the block

properties tab and expanding the

appearance section it cannot accept new

lines so if you want to have several so

if you want to have a several paragraph

block of text you will need several text

blocks the appearance section also

allows you to bind the displayed text to

any parameters the page contains to

demonstrate this let's bind to the

sensor ID parameter save the application

and launch the page on two three four

and the textbox has the value that we

entered into the parameter if you insert

the textbox into another block that

references the datasource it will allow

you to bind the text to any of the

fields in the data source to demonstrate

this we will assign device ID to the

textbox save it and launch the page the

parameter is still here but it does not

matter for this demonstration so we'll

just put 5 the textbox was duplicated

because there was more than one record

in the data source however this is

expected and it did bind correctly to

edit the font and other textual styles

navigate to the blog styling tablet open

the typography section the blog style

manager is explained in further detail

in another video but all of these will

update in real time allowing you to view

and adjust the effects that needing to

launch the page this has been a

demonstration of the text block in app

designer thank you for watching
