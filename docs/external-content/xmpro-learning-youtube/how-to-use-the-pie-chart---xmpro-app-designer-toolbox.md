hi and welcome to another training video

from XM pro today we'll be looking at

how to use the pie chart component as a

prerequisite you should have already

gone through the video on how to create

and use data sources if not then I

recommend doing that first the pie chart

component can be found in the basic

block section in order for the pie chart

to display something you must assign it

a data source I have created one

previously and the data that it needs is

an argument field which is the name or

ID some unique field on on the data

source and the value field is the value

you want to display using the pie chart

so what this looks like

is this we've got Google Bing and

example

we have some appearance options but type

so it can be pie or donut the donut is a

round circle with an inner blank spot

the default inner radius is 0.8 but you

can change that to any number between

zero and one and this is what a doughnut

looks like

we have palette which is the colors that

are used so you need to choose a few

colors in here I'm going to go with red

and orange and yellow and what this does

is it changes the colors of the items in

the pie chart so we've got the red the

orange of the yellow if there are more

items than you have colors for it will

interpolate between the colors so if I

just had for example red and yellow it

would find the midpoint between these

two colors for the third option which is

what it's doing here

we also have the legend which is at the

bottom you could see the names of the

items so you can make this visible or

not and then you can align it top left

middle and right bottom left middle or

right let's go with top middle and then

it's also the tooltip and you can also

show a connecting line which will point

from the tooltip to the segment of the

pie chart so here we've moved the legend

up to the top and we have some tool tips

with connecting lines this has been how

to use the pie chart
