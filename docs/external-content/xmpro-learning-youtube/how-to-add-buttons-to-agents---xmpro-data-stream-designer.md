in this video we will be going over how

to add

a button control to an agent

and then interacting with that control

in a data stream

i have opened up an agent here to

demonstrate how to add that control

to a group so in this case i'm going to

add it to the server group and click the

plus here

i'm going to scroll up i'm going to go

to the type here scroll up

get the button you can see

that we have some options available we

have a key which i'm going to call

verify connection

a caption this is going to be called

verify the connection with no help

text i'm going to have the button be

visible

after i save it we can see that we have

a button here

and i'm going to go through and save it

and we'll go interactive it

on the data stream i have imported our

new agent into the data

stream and they are now ready to look at

the button and see how it works

so in this case i'm going to open up our

pre-configured agent here

with the agent open we can now go

through our

sql connector here and see that we can

verify

our connection with a button here we

have our server

user and password here we're going to

verify that these are correct

so i'm going to click here to verify

we can see that the connection is good

the button has told us and

tested the connection for us now if we

change this

sensor data user to also be the server

so that we know that the details are

invalid we can see

there is the error that comes from the

agent right here now if we click to

verify

again

we can see that we're unable to connect

to the server

same as what the error shows here
