hi my name is Kirsten Schwarzer and

welcome to this ex and pro learning

series on UX design for real-time apps

in this series I'm going to show you a

repeatable process that you can use to

build applications that not only look

good but that also solve real problems

before you jump into the X and Pro app

designer it's important to think deeply

about the problem that you're trying to

solve in our experience thinking through

the problem now will help you spend less

time staring at a blank screen in the

app designer and you'll end up with a

much better result if you're still

deciding which problem to work on we

recommend using the X and Pro use case

prioritization matrix to help you rank

your problems based on their business

impact and their technical feasibility

if you aren't familiar with this matrix

please reach out to our team at support

at X and procom for more details in this

example we're trying to reduce unplanned

downtime of boiler feed pumps in a

thermal power plant we've determined

that this problem has a high impact on

our business and that it's technically

feasible to build a real-time condition

monitoring app with the data that we

have available when we think about this

problem there are five things that we

need to consider firstly what critical

real-time events do you need to know

about when it comes to this problem so

if we want to prevent downtime on our

boiler feed pumps the critical real-time

events that we should know about or

things like spikes in temperature or

vibration going above a certain

threshold next what decisions does the

person using this app need to make to

respond to that event do they need to

decide whether a certain temperature

spike means we need to perform immediate

maintenance on this pump what are the

decisions that they need to make thirdly

what data would the user need to see to

make an informed decision in this

example you want real-time sensor data

from the pump but you might also want to

see the list of scheduled work orders or

the work order

history next is there anything

preventing the user from making a

decision or taking an action

do they need input from someone else or

is there data locked up in a certain

system that they need to get access to

is there a calculation that needs to be

done to figure out what the right action

is or does a machine learning algorithm

need to make a prediction lastly what

key metrics are you trying to improve

this will help you understand why this

is an important problem to solve and

what the potential ROI will be we're

sort of trying to break things down into

first principles and really understand

the problem there's a great Elan musk

quote that says with first principles

you boil things down to the most

fundamental truths and then you reason

up from there in our case we're trying

to break the problem down into the most

fundamental truths and then design our

application from there to make things

easy for you we've created a PowerPoint

template that you can use to answer each

of these questions in a way that's easy

to present and that summarizes your

thinking on one slide you can download

the template by going to the link in the
