hi and welcome to another training video

from XM pro today we will be looking at

how to maintain and capture notes for

your apps notes are a way to share

information about an application between

creators of the app and for future

reference I have created a blank app to

get to notes click on the notes button

in the command bar this is a rich text

editor so you can change your style of

text you can make things bold and

italics and underline and strikethrough

and there are many other things you can

do with this you can add quotes you can

add code blocks you can add lists and

numbered lists you can add you can

increase the indent and decrease the

indent you can change the size of the

text the font of the text color and the

background color of us are the the

highlight color well it is a background

color but I like color of the text you

can change the alignment so left center

right or justified you can insert links

and you can insert images here when this

is safe this is saved per app so it

doesn't matter how many pages you have

when you go into the notes the notes are

always the same

and if you change versions then the

notes will be saved across versions this

has been how to maintain and capture

notes
