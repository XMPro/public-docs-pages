# Platform Security

XMPro places a high priority on security, performing app security checks every 3 months using Veracode. Veracode's comprehensive analysis helps identify, prevent, and fix vulnerabilities through multiple testing methods: Static Analysis (white-box testing), Dynamic Analysis (black-box testing), and Software Composition Analysis.

## **Security Technologies and Practices**

Our suite of products leverages robust technologies and practices to maintain a high security standard:

* **App Designer**, **Data Stream Designer**, and **XMPro AI** are built on **dotnet 8**.
* **Subscription Manager** is built on **net481**.

In the event a vulnerability is identified in any of these technologies, Microsoft promptly releases an update. We integrate these updates into our products and regularly release new versions that include essential security fixes.

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a form of white-box testing used to scan an application’s source, binary, or byte code.

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) analyzes a web application through the front end to find vulnerabilities through simulated attacks. This is also called Penetration testing.

### Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

Software Composition Analysis scans all the components used in an application for security risks and vulnerabilities.
