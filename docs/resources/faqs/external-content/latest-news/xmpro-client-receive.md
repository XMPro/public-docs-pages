<p>Dallas, TX, U.S.A, November 2012 – XMPro client, Recreational Services Ltd – specializes in the management and maintenance of parks, turf and sporting facilities across New Zealand – won supreme honors at the Westpac Auckland North Business Awards on the 26<sup>th</sup> October 2012. Run by Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development (ATEED), the Awards’ purpose is to honor local companies, their people and their achievements. This year the Awards attracted 143 entries from a diverse mix of companies, and has become the premier local business event. Recreational Services claimed the honorable Babcock Excellence in Leadership Award before winning the evening’s top prize, the Westpac Supreme Business Excellence Award. “We were impressed with the overall management of Recreational Services. Its solid processes, clear direction and exceptional leadership has created a successful business,” says Mr. Bellingham, Chairman of Judges.</p>
<p>XMPro, with Professional Advantage as the Implementation Partner, has supported Recreational Services in its work as its Business Process Management Solution. Initiating with the automation of Recreational Service’s main business processes, XMPro then facilitated continuous improvement initiatives and helped strengthen Recreational Service’s links between its people, processes and technology. “Since our Continuous Improvement of Processes and Systems (CIPS) initiative we’ve probably put on $3 million of business without growing our administration team.” said Keitha Turner, Director of Recreational Services. This created the the potential to grow the company by another 30% without increasing overheads, it also ensured staff remained engaged and excited about this initiative. Turner continues, “XMPro has given us the building blocks to assist us in planning, prioritizing, and most importantly, it provides the tools to implement system optimization cost effectively”.</p>
<p>To showcase this business improvement strategy and transformation, Recreational Services was recently invited by Gartner Inc. to present their XMPro case study at the Gartner BPM Summit in Sydney 2012. “We are very proud of Recreational Services. Its vision for continuous improvement drives its success and is a showcase for XMPro as a tool to deliver process improvements. It is a company that is intelligent about its operations and is getting better at getting work done,” says Pieter van Schalkwyk, CEO of XMPro Inc.</p>
