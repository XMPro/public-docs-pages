</a>GARTNER SYMPOSIUM/ITxpo, FL., 26 September, 2012 – XMPro Inc. today announced their participation in the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo 2012 as a Business Process Management Marketplace sponsor.  After their recent label as a Cool Vendor* for BPM in 2012, XMPro will get an opportunity to showcase their acknowledgement and display their work around Intelligent Business Operations, a much deliberated theme recently unveiled by Gartner.</p>
<p>Following last year’s urge for CIOs and senior IT executives to re-imagine, rethink and reconsider what IT means and how it can be applied to the needs and goals of the enterprise, Gartner promises to escalate the quest in this year’s gathering by focusing on the disruptive technologies of cloud, social, mobile and information. Delegates can look forward to Keynotes from John T. Chambers, Chairman and CEO, Cisco; Meg Whitman, President and CEO, HP; and General Colin Powell, USA (Retired) to name a few.  Pieter van Schalkwyk, CEO of XMPro comments, “We are enthusiastic about this gathering and the work Gartner is doing with CIO’s in constructing IT architecture that focusses, connects and leads their enterprises. We believe that our platform around Intelligent Business Operations will help CIO’s accomplish this goal”.</p>
<p>Gartner Symposium/ITxpo is the industry’s largest and most strategic conference for CIOs and senior IT executives. More than 8,000 senior business and IT strategists, including more than 2,000 CIOs, will gather for the insights, tools and solutions they need to ensure that their IT initiatives are key contributors to and drivers of their enterprise’s success. Although XMPro is the newest addition to the BPM Solution Showcase this year, the company created hype in the recent Gartner BPM Summit in Sydney and promises to bring to the table an unconventional, innovative, business friendly BPM technology. XMPro embraces the concept of creating and sustaining business value with a solution that enables operation managers to get control over their people, their business activities and processes, and their business or IT systems. This year XMPro’s solution showcase will be a fundamental pit stop in test driving a recognized iBPMS designed to solve real-world process problems for customers across a broad range of industries.</p>
<p>Held on the 21<sup>st</sup>-25<sup>th</sup> October 2012 at the Walt Disney World Dolphin Hotel in Orlando, Florida, the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo will disclose proven BPM management disciplines and reveal the latest BPM technologies.
