<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Effective short-term inventory planning is crucial for businesses to maintain operational efficiency, meet customer demands, and minimize costs. However, several challenges can impede optimal inventory management:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Demand Forecasting:</strong> Accurately predicting short-term product demand is challenging, leading to either stock shortages or excess inventory.</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chain Disruptions:</strong> Unforeseen disruptions in the supply chain can quickly render inventory plans obsolete, causing delays and increased costs.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Efficient allocation of resources for inventory management, including storage space and logistics, is complex and dynamic.</li>
<li><strong>Data Integration:</strong> Integrating data from various sources (sales, supply chain, market trends) for informed decision-making is often cumbersome.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid Response to Market Changes:</strong> Adapting quickly to market fluctuations or changes in customer preferences is essential for maintaining service levels and competitiveness.</li>
</ol>
