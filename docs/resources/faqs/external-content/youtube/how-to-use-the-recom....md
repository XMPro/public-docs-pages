the recommendation chart is useful to

check the status of your items at a

glance by displaying the number and

severity of unresolved alerts for one or

more recommendations to begin drag the

recommendations chart onto the page with

that configuration this will display a

chart of all open recommendations alerts

grouped by their severity you can also

filter the recommendations that are

included in the account by selecting

them here D selecting all

recommendations will call us all

recommendations to be counted which is

the best method of doing so as it will

automatically include recommendations

created after the page is designed well

launch the page to view the difference

in configuration the chart on the left

is counting all recommendation alerts

while the chart on the right he's n the

counting the selected recommendations

and thus has a small account this has

been a demonstration of the

recommendation shot in app designer
