welcome to another training video from

exam pro

today we'll be looking at linear gauge

and how to use it in app designer

dna gauge can be found in the basic

category or you can search it from the

search text box right here

let me drag it to the box that you want

to display and show you the default

layout of linear gauge

from here you can see we have a range

from 0 to 100

the indicators show the current value

and the title and now jump into the

active mode to change the rate how it

looks

now we're going to block properties of

the linear gauge

and the appearance you see feasible

option

it will be the same as the other app

design controls

and we can change the title here

now we say we change it to

temperature

we can also change the orientation of

linear gauge

the default value is horizontal and we

can change it to vertical

the font color will be applied to the

step

of the vena gauge as well as the title

now now we change it to a darker color

the interval would be the value between

each step of the name gauge

the default value is 10 and we can

change it to

five in a gauge

can be display more than one value

if you want to add more value it will be

under the sub values category

and we can also change the indicator

type for subfolios

we can change it to rectangles circle

etc

but for demo purposes we keep it as text

cloud

we can change the text format to

percentage if we want to

also we can change the indicator color

so we'll change it to purple

we can also configure the indicate

offset

if we want to display the indicator in a

different location

in the behavior we can set the range of

the linear gauge

the default would be zero two hundred

and we can change it to zero to

sixty

and the value we can configure the value

of the

linear gauge

we can change it to 40. also we can add

this up value by clicking on the

plus button

again specify 10

and 20. now i'm going to show you

the changes that we have made

now you see the knee gauge having

changed our attention

from horizontal to vertical we have a

value of 40

and 2s of 5 20 and 10.

we can also change the title from linear

gauge to temperature

let's say we want to read the value from

a dollar source rather than static value

and we can jump back to the ethnic

mirror and see how we can configure that

make the linear gauge free from the data

source you must add the

inner gauge to a controller support data

source for example

a box or another repeater from here

already configure the box to connect a

sql table now we can drag it

linear gauge into that box

we go to the value and the properties

from here we can change the value from

static merit to dynamic merit

and now we can select the data source

from here

the same can be applied to the sub

values as well

and this is nina gage in app designer
