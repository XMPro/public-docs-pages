welcome to another training video from

XM Pro today we will be looking at how

to share a use case here I have a use

case that I would like to share with a

co-worker to do this press on the share

button and you can see that there is

access granted to me because I am the

owner and you can add another user here

so I'm going to share it with

Christopher Vela and I'm going to give

him read permission and that's all you

need to do to share it with and with the

coworker you can click on one of them

here and change the permissions so now

Chris has a write access which means

that he will be able to make changes to

this use case and save them if I go back

to my home page and into my sandbox

Chris has shared a couple of use cases

with me he's given me read access to

this one so if I go in to share we can

see that he is the owner and I have read

access which means that I can move

things around but if I try to save this

it's not going to save and if I try to

go into properties of something change

things around and try to try to save

these it's not going to do anything

however if I go on to the right access

one and we can see that I have write

access here then I can make changes I

can move things around and save these

and then if I go out and then again

we'll see that that the changes have

been saved

so that's how to share a use case
