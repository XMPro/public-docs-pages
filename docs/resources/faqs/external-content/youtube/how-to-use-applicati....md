application versions

in this video we will look at how to

manage versions of a given application

when you create a new application it

always starts with a version 1.0

as you go and make further changes to

your application

the minor version will keep on

incrementing but the major version will

stay the same

although the minor version version

changes but those minor versions are not

check pointed or you cannot roll back to

them if you need to

in order to create a major version you

need to click on versions

and then you will be presented with

display which is basically responsible

for all the version management

over here you can create a major version

which allows you to create a checkpoint

where you can roll back to

if needed it also allows you

to keep on modifying or eye trading over

your app

while it is also published and your

users are using it

and once you're ready with your new

version you can seamlessly switch over

to it and all your users will start to

use

the new version in order to create a new

version

you have to select the base version that

you want

to use and you can click copy that will

create a new later version

based on that as you can see we are now

creating a version 3.

similarly you can click on the delete

button if you require

to remove the version this list also

shows you which version

is published at any given time

one thing to note is that if you are on

this

dashboard or tile view and your app is

published

you will notice that it will display the

version which is published and clicking

on it will always take you

to the published version regardless if

it is the latest one or not

however if you have design time access

for the same app

and you click on the bit button that

will always take you to the latest

version

which might be the one you're working on

you would note that if you're on a

version which is not the published one

you get both buttons published and

unpublished

clicking on unpublished will unpublish

the version which is currently published

however clicking publish but not only

i'll

unpublish that version but also publish

this one instead

if you would like to navigate to a

different version

you can go to the version manager select

the version you would like to navigate

or work with

and click on the view button that will

take you to the version

you selected

this is how your version control your

applications
