<summary>Transcript</summary>hello and welcome to another training

video from XM pro today we'll be looking

at how to create app pages and how to

create navigation flow between pages as

a prerequisite you should have already

gone through the video on how to create

an application if not then I recommend

doing that first now assuming that

you've already created a blank app the

app will be created with a landing page

I've added some texts to my landing page

to spice it up a little bit the landing

page is the first page that you will see

when running the app some apps will only

need one page but most likely your

application will need more pages to

display information and to do that

different actions to create a new page

press the plus button this will bring up

a form to fill in with the name of the

new page and the theme end of this

information and press add this will

create a blank page you can see how the

page looks from run time by pressing the

launch button blank pages are created

with the button that navigates you back

to the landing page however as it is

right now you won't actually be able to

get to the new page from the landing

page what we can do

to allow navigation to the new page is

to go into the landing page and add any

action block I will add a button but

this will work for any action component

now I will select the button and go

through its block properties you can

also double click the box to do this go

into action properties and make the

action navigate to page then select the

page that you want to navigate to I'm

also going to give the button some text

now we can save the page and see how

this looks when you run the application

so this is your landing page in the

button which has the action go to

secondary page and you click on it you

get to the secretary page and there's

your button to go back to the landing

page again

that's how you create app pages and

navigate between them
