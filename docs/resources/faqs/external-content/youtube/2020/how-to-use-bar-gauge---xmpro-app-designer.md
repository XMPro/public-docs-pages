<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to another training video from

exam pro today we've been looking at

package and how to use it in app

designer

baggage can be found under the basic

category or you can search it from the

search text box right here

now reject it to the location you want

to display

let me show you the default layout of

the bar gauge

the default layer of the package

consists of range from 0 to 100

and the title with 5 gauge

let's say we want to make some changes

in here

you can go to the editor

click on the package click on the prop

properties

under appearance you can see the visible

option

that would be the same as the other app

designer control

now we can change the title from bar

gauge

to engine temperature the font color

is the color of the title so now we can

select a darker color

bar spacing is the space between each

bar

um you can specify in here the label

is used for displaying the path value

so now we keep it for visible for now

and also we can change the format of the

label

we can either select one of the default

layout

or we can specify a custom format

for example we want to display the value

with degree celsius so we can

specify in here for more information on

how to

customize your format you can click on

the help button

and we show you the details on how to

specify a custom format

and the behavior we can change the range

of the bar gauge

by default it's 0 to 100 and we can

change it to 0 to 120

in the baggage let's set multiple value

to add a value

you can click the plus button in here

and we can specify the value of 45

and 70.

now we save it and show you the changes

that we have made

now you can see the title have been

changed from

baggage to engine temperature

and the value will display with degree

celsius label in here

also we will see there's a space between

each bar with 5 pixel

finally if you want the baggage value

it's reading from a dollar source

you have to add the bar gauge

into the controller that allows starter

source

for example a box and a data repeater

in here already configured a box that

have a dollar source to read from a sql

table

so now if we drag a bar gauge into that

box

and the value if you add a new value and

change from static value to a dynamic

value

click on the dropbox now you can see you

can select a

column from a sql table

and this is how you configure the

package

thank you for watching
