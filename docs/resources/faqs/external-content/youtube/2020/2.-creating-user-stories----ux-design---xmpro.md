<summary>Transcript</summary>now that we have a better understanding

of the problem we're trying to solve

it's time to create user stories for our

new app why is it important to create

user stories the whole process of user

experience design is about keeping your

focus on the application user since

they're the one you're building it for

and even though you might be the

designer and the user in some instances

creating user stories helps you put

yourself in the users shoes and stay

focused on the results you want them to

achieve with your app we recommend you

write your user stories in this format

as a persona I want to so that let's

look at each of the three parts as a

persona think about who's going to be

your app's main user I want to what

action are they trying to complete

resist the urge here to simply list the

features you want to build so that

consider the overall benefit they want

or the big problem they're trying to

solve for example as a plant manager I

want to get an overall view of my asset

health so that I can identify any

bottlenecks another example as the head

of maintenance I want to see open work

orders for my boiler feed pumps so that

I can manage our maintenance planning

when a pump breaks down unexpectedly to

create your own user stories you can
