<summary>Transcript</summary>hi and welcome to another training video

from XM pro today we will be looking at

how to use form validation form

validation is how you prevent an action

such as a button click from happening if

the user has entered some information

incorrectly to get to validation click

on one of your controls go to the block

properties tab and under validation you

have validation group we'll get back to

this later and then we have required if

you check required then this field will

not accept an empty value I'm going to

leave this off for now and then we have

pattern what gets entered into the

pattern field is a regular expression or

regex

I'm not going to go into too much detail

here but for instance this full name

will require at least two words so we

have word of word character and then

plus for more than one and then a space

and then another carrot another word

character and a plus for more than one

and then the pattern message this will

show up if this pattern is not matched

so we'll put in here for name needs at

least two names and then we have a

number selector this also has validation

so we can put in here required and then

age is required for the message that

will show up and then in order to check

this validation we need to go into the

button I've already set an action on

this navigate to landing page and then

we go in the validation tab we can

select all validation groups or just

check this the default validation group

and then we save the form and I'll show

you what happens so we have this form

here if we press submit it's going to

check these and it's going to say oh

this name is required and I probably

should have put that on the full name as

well but I didn't

so it's not checking for that however if

I type in David as one half of my name

and then click off it's going to say

full name needs at least two names

you

and then age 27 and then if we click

Submit it's going to do the submission

and go to the next page

so what validation groups are let's say

you have a duplicate of this on the same

page somewhere else or you have some

other form that you'll that you want to

check go into the full name text box go

to validation and then we want a new

validation group so we say second form

and then create and then we check the

second form as the validation group and

because we've already created this group

it's there so we can just check it for

age and then this button instead of

validating all the groups we just want

it to validate it's the second form

group so I save this then we go in again

and if I press submit on the second one

it's only going to submit the second

form if I press the first one it's going

to validate all groups because that's

what was selected on that this has been
