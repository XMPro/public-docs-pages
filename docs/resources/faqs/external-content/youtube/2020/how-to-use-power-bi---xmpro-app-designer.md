<summary>Transcript</summary>in this video we will be looking at the

power bi control

the power bi control allows you to embed

reports inside your application

if we go to the design view of our page

here

you can use it by simply

[Music]

dragging it across from the toolbox

and then configuring it under behavior

you have to provide some settings

so that you can embed the report

the first setting it asks you for is the

report id which you can find on the

power bi website

so if i go to my report in the address

bar here i can see the report id

you can copy that

and add it to the report id next is

authentication modes you have two

options either user or

application user authentication is used

when you want to embed for your

organization

your users will be required to sign in

and have a power bi account

this will also require you to have a

power bi premium license

the other option is to use application

authentication

if you choose application authentication

you can embed

your report for your customers and they

will not be required to sign in

however you're required to have a power

bi

embedded license for this

in order to set up your report to use

application authentication you have to

follow some instructions

which can be found

on the microsoft website and i will

leave the link in the description

once you follow these instructions and

create all the necessary

authentication settings you will then be

able to embed that report

inside your application

so this link explains where to find

these settings for example

application id can be found here along

with the tenant id

workspace id or the group id as being

asked over there can be found here

and lastly the secret is what you would

have created or set up

in this link here

at this point once you have done all the

setup and you have provided all the

values

you can then launch your app

and you would see the report where

you're using application

authentication will not ask you for a

sign-in

however if you're using user

authentication you will be asked for a

sign-in

clicking on sign in will take you to

microsoft website

where you have to sign in with your

power bi account

once you're done you will notice that

your report will load up

it is important to note that for the

sign in

for power bi to work your browser should

be allowing

the cookies so this is how you use the

power bi control to embed

your power bi reports inside app

designer
