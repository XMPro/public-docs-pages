<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to another training video from

Excel Pro today we will be looking at

how to manage and use server variables

when you are configuring your use case

objects you may notice that some of them

say use connection variables as a

checkbox and if you have this use

connection variables checked it gives

you a drop-down to select from a list if

you if you uncheck this then you can

enter your details here for instance my

server connection my username and my

password but let's say you want to

configure many different use case

objects with these same parameters or

variables how you would do that is go to

the variables button page and then press

add to add a new variable you can name

the variable and give it a category and

then give it a value and then if you

save this and go back into your use case

and configure your object then in the

dropdowns here you'll see that there's a

new connection there and when you select

this connection it will use the value

that you entered so you can also have

categories so if I manage the categories

and I add one that's called sequel

connections and then save that then we

can add this to the sequel connections

category and we can add more than one so

another the connection and there's

something some other connection here

will add to the sequel connections and

then you can see that this connection is

in the sequel connections as well and if

you go back to the use case it will be

in there in there in the drop down

you can have multiple categories so if

you don't want to give out your password

then you can add add your password and

let's say you don't want them you don't

want anyone to be able to see this

password you can encrypt it then your

value will be encrypted

so if you want to give this my sequel

connection and then the password my ex

equal password and these will be saved

throughout the site so you can reuse

these connections or passwords or user

names anywhere you go this has been how

to manage and use server variables
