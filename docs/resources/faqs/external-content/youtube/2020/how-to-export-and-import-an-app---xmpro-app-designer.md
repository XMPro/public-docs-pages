<summary>Transcript</summary>if you have multiple installations of

app designer for instance a development

and a production environment you may

need a way to copy apps from one

location to another this is when it

becomes useful to export and import

applications to export an app go to the

Edit played and click the export button

this dialog will appear asking if you

want to export sensitive information in

your connections like passwords that

have been encrypted by app designer if

you choose yes the encrypted information

will by necessity be saved in the

exported file in a decrypted State if

you select no the encrypted information

will not be saved at all and you will

need to reconfigure your connections

once you import the application

elsewhere cancel will stop the export

completely once you have selected either

yes or no you can export the file

please note that app design attracts

unique information in each app to

prevent more than one copy existing on

any given installation at a time this

means that if we try to import our app

right now it will fail because this

instance already exists we need to

delete it before we can import it again

to import an app

navigate to the applications blade and

click import from here upload the

exported app file the import process

requires the exact versions of the

connectors used by the imported app if

any are missing an error page will be

shown listing them if you get this page

either install these connectors yourself

or contact your administrator to install

them for you to try uploading the same

or a different file click discard once

you have uploaded the file with no

errors you will be prompted for some

details fill them out and click Save

please note that if the application

already exists this will be the step

that throws an error one final step is

required if the app contained any blocks

using data sources these will need to be

remapped

once the data source is reselected the

block should work with no further

changes required

this has been how to export an import

and application in App designer thank

you for watching this video and I hope

it has helped
