welcome to another training video from

accent pros today we will be looking at

how to create and manage templates now

what is the temple template basically as

the name suggests is sort of a

pre-configured app that you may have

already structured and created the

layout in a certain way and that you

want to reuse um so template allows you

to basically store that structure and

layout and then when you wanna create a

new app um use that template to give you

a bit of head start now how a template

is created is for example I am in this

app that I have created

it's called asset even board it has two

pages a landing page an asset details

page if I look at the landing page

you'll see that I have already laid out

all the controls that I need in order to

display some information of my asset I

have nicely structured a gauge and a

chart here which may which might be

displaying some key information maybe

some real-time data coming from that

asset along with that I have a

recommendations list coming up over here

which might be giving me some alerts as

as per the condition monitoring um that

might be configured on that message

similarly I have a great here where I

might want to display service history or

work history of that asset lastly I have

an image popping up here um where I

might want to display a CAD diagram or a

blow-up of that asset maybe it is a

submersible pump and I wanna display

scant diagram over there so now that I

have done all this work here I have

realized that I also need to do this for

multiple apps when I create different

type of assets they usually all start

with a similar landing page and the best

thing I can do is if I create a template

of this then I will not have to do this

every time and I'll get that bit of a

head start and that's not only just for

me but also for any other user

who is creating similar apps they will

also be able to use my template so how

do we create a template well let's go to

our app and if I pop into the more menu

you'll see there's a save template

option I can click on that and once I

change the basic information that it is

asking me of a template like a name and

description

the only other information I may want to

provide here is which category it should

belong to and what screenshots it should

have so I'll choose a screenshot and

that will help other people when they

want to look at my template to

understand what it contains now now I am

ready to save but you can save it will

then be added to my list of templates

now in the second part how do we manage

these templates if I click on the

templates option here it will display me

a list of all my templates and if I want

to change one of my templates perhaps I

want to perhaps I want to change their

name or description or change the

category they belong to or change its

images um I can do so over here along

with that I have option to delete that

am template and also to import and

export them but that's the topic of a

separate video so that was how you

create and manage templates in the next

video we will see how to actually use

this template when I want to create a

new app thank you so much
