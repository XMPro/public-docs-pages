<summary>Transcript</summary>when we are they to do here is look at

how to set up and configure the fireless

in the agent the purpose of this agent

is to monitor directory for files for

example I have a directory year that I

want to monitor which is a folder called

sensor readings that is located on my

desktop I also have an archive folder in

this folder which I will explain in a

second now let's go to test room

designer to set up this agent go to the

toolbox and search for file you will

find it under listeners click on the

agent and drag it to the canvas note

that a default name has been given to

this agent to rename this agent click on

the white space and start typing click

somewhere else on the canvas and click

using the correct collection if you'd

like to change this just elect another

collection from the drop-down next you

need to set your polling interval if I

leave this as 10 it will check the

directory for files or changes every 10

seconds then you'll see there's a target

directory path field on this form which

you need to fall in this is the path to

the directory you want to monitor if

you'd like to include such direct trees

in this directory which needs to be

monitored select the check box then you

need to specify your search pattern

which is helpful if you want to narrow

down the type of files you want to

monitor for example if I just want to

monitor CSV files I'm going to change

this to start at CSV lastly you need to

specify your archive directory path

which is the directory to the archive

folder that I mentioned before where

files will be moved once detected

click apply and click Save to run your

stream click on publish to view the live

data click on live view select your file

agent and click Save

as you can see the father I've pasted in

here has been moved to the archive

territory in a live view expand the page
