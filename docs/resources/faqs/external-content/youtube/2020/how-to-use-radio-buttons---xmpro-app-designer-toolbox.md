<summary>Transcript</summary>hi and welcome to another training video

from XM pro today we will be looking at

how to use the radio buttons component

as a prerequisite I'd recommend going

through the video on how to create data

sources before watching this video the

radio buttons component can be found in

the basic section of the blocks this

component doesn't look like much on the

designer because I haven't added any

data yet to add data go to the data

source accordion item of the block

properties and then you can choose

static items or a dynamic data source

I'm going to go with dynamic data to

begin with and then you choose your data

source I have created this data source

previously and then you go into the data

tab and choose your display expression

this is the column that's going to show

up as the label and then the value

expression this is what the value of the

item that you select is going to be now

if I just save this and launch then we

can see how this looks so we've got a

list of people and you can click on one

of them to select them there are a

couple of properties that you can change

appearance visible is self-explanatory

and then orientation if I say horizontal

then the radio buttons are going to go

left to right instead of top to bottom

there's also disabled in the behavior so

if I launch this with horizontal this is

how it looks I'm going to drag in

another radio buttons to show you the

static items so if you go into data

source and change the mode to static

items then it gives you a grid where you

can add your items here

I'll sort by value just to be there we

go yep so we've got three items in here

if we save this and launch why is it

okay then we've got John Becky and David

for the second radio button opponent and

the original ones still there this has

been how to use the radio buttons
