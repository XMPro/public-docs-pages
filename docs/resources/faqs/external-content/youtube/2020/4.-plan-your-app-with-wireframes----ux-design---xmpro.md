<summary>Transcript</summary>when designing any application it's good

practice to create a rough sketch of

your ideas on a whiteboard or a piece of

paper we like to create wireframes using

a simple two-step process first start by

drawing thumbnails for each page in your

user flow diagram if you're doing it on

paper draw a series of two-inch blocks

where you can try out different layouts

on a whiteboard they can be slightly

larger now you don't need to be an

artist to draw wireframes the task here

is not to create a masterpiece you

simply want to try out your ideas

quickly we recommend creating three to

five thumbnail size layout ideas for

each page in your app decide which

layouts you like and then move on to

step two which is drawing slightly

larger more detailed wireframes of the

layouts that you've chosen you can use a

ruler to draw straight lines but don't

worry about it being perfect it's also a

good idea to add notes on the side of

your larger wireframes to add some

context and important things that you

need to keep in mind
