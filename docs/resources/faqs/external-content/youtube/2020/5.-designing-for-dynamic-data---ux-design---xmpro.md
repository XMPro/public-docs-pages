<summary>Transcript</summary>if you followed all the steps in this

series you've given yourself the best

chance of building a well-designed

application that solves a real problem

but there is one final thing you need to

understand before you get to work in the

Exim Pro app designer X and pro apps use

dynamic real time data the X and Pro

data stream designer allows you to

integrate to multiple data sources apply

analytics initiate actions and

orchestrate the flow of data that data

then gets used by the apps you create in

the app designer we won't be covering it

in this series but now is also the time

to consider which X and Pro data streams

you need to configure and think about

whether you have access to the right

data sources that you'll need to use in

your app using dynamic data also means

that you'll need to create dynamic

layouts while this might take a while to

get used to this will save you a lot of

design time let's say you want to create

a page in the app designer that contains

cards showing the overall health for

each of your six slurry pumps in this

simple example the real time data will

come from a database now instead of

creating 6 cards for your 6 slurry pumps

you only have to create one card as the

template when you launch your app that

template will then get replicated for

each row in your database and if you add

data for two more pumps to the database

your page will automatically show 8

cards now that you understand how to

design layouts for dynamic data it's

time to turn your wireframes

into X and Pro apps for a detailed

tutorial on creating your first app
