<summary>Transcript</summary>in this video we will be looking at

data stream types

a data stream can be of two types

streaming

or recurrent you can choose that

at the time of creating a new use case

or by going to its properties

notice over here there is an option to

choose the type

which can be streaming or recurrent

streaming type has been covered

extensively in other videos the current

type which we will be discussing today

allows you to create a use case where

your listeners or context providers

do not run on a polling interval which

could be 5 or 10 seconds

in a streaming use case and instead

they run on a schedule so if you go to

the configuration of any

of your listener or context provider

given that your use case type is now

returned you will notice

it no longer displays you an option for

a polling interval

instead you have this control where you

can choose the recurrence

um for this agent let's say i want this

to start

at 9 00 a.m

[Music]

every day then i can do that by giving

it a start time

and say that i would like it to repeat

every

one day as per standard repairs controls

you have the option to choose an end

date

or number of appearances after which it

will stop running

now when i publish my use case this

agent which is supposed to

look at a directory and monitor for

changes

will be executed 9 am from tomorrow

i have other options in recurrence like

weekly where i can

i can choose something to run every one

or two weeks

i can also specify which days in that

week it should run on

and similarly i have the end um

condition over here

likewise you can see we have monthly

or yearly um recurrence where you can

choose

something should something should repeat

every one year on a certain date

so that is how you configure a recurrent

data stream
