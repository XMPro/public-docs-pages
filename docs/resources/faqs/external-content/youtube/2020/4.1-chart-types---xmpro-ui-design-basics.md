<summary>Transcript</summary>if you're taking this course to get

better at building apps with the xmpro

app designer

it's important to have a good

understanding of data visualization

most of your interfaces will probably

consist of many different charts

and interface elements that you'll need

to choose and style appropriately

so let's look at when to choose which

type of chart

if you want to measure a change over a

period of time there are four types of

charts that are ideal for the scenario

to show trends or compare across

categories over a period of time

you can choose either a line chart a bar

chart

stacked bar or an area chart

now if you want to compare multiple

distinct categories with each other

you have four different options a bar

chart

a grouped bar chart bubble chart or a

multi-line chart

and if you're looking at comparing how

partial elements add up to a total

you can either use a stacked bar a pie

chart a doughnut chart or a stacked area

chart

and if you're looking to show

correlation between two or more

variables

you can use a scatter plot a bubble

chart or a column and line chart

now if you're looking for more resources

on this topic i highly recommend the

data visualization page on material.io

stick around for the next lesson which

is our final one on chart styling
