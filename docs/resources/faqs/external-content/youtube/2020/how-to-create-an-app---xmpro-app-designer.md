<summary>Transcript</summary>applications are a method of viewing

data about your company's resources you

can set them up to get a broad overview

or see the vital statistics of a

particular area or item or even start

with the wide view and drill down into

the details you want to see this video

will show you the bare minimum of

creating an application while later

videos will go into more detail about

how to fill it with data and information

to create an application click the new

application command this takes you to

the template selection dashboard these

templates only affect the initial design

of the application and are useful to

reduce time spent designing or when

creating multiple similar apps selecting

or deselecting these categories can help

filter the templates down to the one you

want as can the search bar up top to

continue select the template you wish to

use alternatively you could select the

applications blade this escapes the

template selection and automatically

selects a blank template for you either

way the new app blade opens here you can

add a name a description

and an icon

you can also assign a category to keep

it in as well as a default theme light

or dark

that will affect any new pages that you

create click the Save button to save the

new application to run the app navigate

to the chosen category and select the

new app which will always open the apps

landing page there isn't much here

naturally since we are using the blank

app template to close it click the close

button in the top right hand corner to

edit the app including its properties

select the pencil icon from here you'll

be able to see and edit the pages of the

app and perform administration tasks via

these commands both of which will be

explained in other videos clicking on

the properties command allows you to

edit any of the details from when you

created the app except for the template

you can also select a different landing

page which will affect which page is

displayed whenever you run the app this

has been how to create an application in

app designer thank you for watching this

video and I hope it's helped
