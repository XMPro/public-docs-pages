welcome to another training video from

Acheson pro today we will be looking at

how to manage categories in app designer

or data stream designer if you look at

it if you look at app designer you'll

see that the first landing screen you

see it says categories and that's where

you're looking at a couple of categories

like aggression intelligence analysis or

sandbox

these categories are shared between all

the apps like app designer the stream

designers etc now what do categories

mean they basically allow you to group

your use cases or applications into

logical areas organizations have the

flexibility to create categories based

on their specific requirements maybe

using as a hierarchy or their

organizational structure for any other

logical grouping that you may want but

typically what we see is that they are

grouped according to the application

types

perhaps predictive maintenance or

equipment 5 etc in here you can see that

I have a category oppression oppressions

intelligence and if I go and I see the

applications that belong to that

category you'll have the same view in

downstream designer where you can go

into a category and you will see the use

cases which belong to that category now

how do we manage these categories if I

look at the search side menu over here

you'll see there is an option to manage

categories if I click on it it will give

me a list of all my categories in my

environment I have a couple of options

here I can add new category by clicking

the plus button and then typing its name

[Music]

my predictive maintenance I can give it

some description and choose an icon and

then it will be added the other option I

have here is if I wanna modify an

existing category I can click on it give

me its details like its name description

or the icon and I can choose to edit

these as I want along with that also if

if it's needed I can delete the category

deleting a category will transfer my

applications and use cases into the

default category which happens to be my

sandbox so if I deleted anything that

belonged to this category will

automatically be moved into my sandbox

however you will never be allowed to

delete my sandbox because that is a

default category and as all this is

always supposed to be there the last

thing you can do here is for example if

you want to order these categories into

a certain hierarchy you can't do that by

clicking on these arrows for example if

I want display data to actually appear

over there I can do that and then if I

click Save that order then be persistent

and on the landing screen you will see

categories appear in that order

so that was how to manage categories

thank you so much
