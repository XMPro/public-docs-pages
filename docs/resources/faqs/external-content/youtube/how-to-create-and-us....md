welcome to another training video

phonics improv today we will be looking

at how to create and use widgets in app

designers widgets are basically controls

in the toolbox which are created by

youth by the user so the idea is let's

say I have created this nice layout over

here to display my asset information and

I have done all the hard work to make it

look nice and appear in the right order

etc now I may need to do the same thing

in other apps or other pages and I don't

want to redo all this work so what I can

do is I can actually click on the

control or the layout that I have

created and I want to extract the widget

out from and click on the Save button

here when I do that it's gonna ask me

some details of the new widget for

example names so the name I can choose

to be asset guard for example and then

in the visibility I have two options

either I can choose myself or everyone

what that will do is if I choose

everyone this visit will not only be

available to me but also available to

everyone in my company and they will be

able to use the control that I am about

to create so I will do that and then in

icon I can just use any icons and once I

created if I go to the widgets section

in my toolbox you will see a new widget

has been created and it's called asset

card I can drag it across onto my canvas

and you will see that it creates the

same layout and same controls I also

have the option to adapt that widget

change its name or diluted or perhaps

change its visibility you find it so

this was how to create and use widgets

thank you so much

you
