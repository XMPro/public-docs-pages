in this video i will go over the

content card block in the block section

of app designer

the content card block is a

pre-configured control that we can use

to have a uniform layout throughout our

app pages

so let's show this in action i have a

content card here

when you drag it into the canvas you see

that there's a heading

and a box the style is already

pre-configured for you

with that in mind i will demonstrate

what the layout card looks like if we

put a data grid inside so we can see

how it fits inside to put a data grid in

here

so when we publish here we can see that

the grid fits perfectly inside the box

and the heading is nice and clean above

the data grid
