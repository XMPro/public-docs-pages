🔹 The challenges of using ESBs for end customers...
so the the the well the main one is to

use an ESB

um is a development uh job

so you can't put an ESB in front of a

End customer or an end user or a

engineer

and expect them to use it because they

won't they don't know how to connect to

it and actually use it the the end

audience to to actually configure and

put this together is that engineer that

that subject matter expert without

having to code and put it together

so how can you very easily drag it on

double click configure so we're we're a

layer above an ESP

um or an Enterprise service bus that

helps simplify a lot of the the

integration pieces that that go

underneath it

um let me find another example here

oh yeah

if I go into

this here this is our main demo site

again

and let's go here so not so much an ESB

but have you are you familiar with Azure

digital twin

so and to to actually configure and use

another digital twin you need to go into

the Azure portal

and configure it there and it's a very

technical exercise too to actually do

that

this here isn't is an agent that I'll

double click that and I can just select

my details here where's my endpoint

there is all the twins that I have

published in this or to get context if I

want to pass data back and update my

digital twin again you would have to

typically go into Azure go into the

portal and Fiddle around there to be

able to do this and deploy it this agent

here I can select everything that I'm

looking for so there's my model there is

my tuna ID there is my relationship and

if I go to the actual mapping on the

Arrow I can map my incoming data to the

data that the twin is making available

and what happens underneath the hood

here is we take care of all the back end

Plumbing

so we can now put this in front of a

non-technical end user and they can

actually use it so very similar concept

to putting it on top of an ESP does it

make sense

so inside the actual agent over here

you'll see there is a upload new model

what you can actually do as well is you

can from an app perspective actually

create an app that will allow you to

configure that Json file

so if I go into

I don't think I have a full example of

that

but you could come in here and actually

configure your hierarchy configure your

your you know properties Etc and then

you could have an option here that says

well

the pro you can do that in here as well
