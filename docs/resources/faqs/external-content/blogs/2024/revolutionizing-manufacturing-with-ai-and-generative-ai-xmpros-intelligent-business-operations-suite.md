## Revolutionizing Manufacturing with AI and Generative AI: XMPro’s Intelligent Business Operations Suite

Posted on [April 11, 2024](https://xmpro.com/revolutionizing-manufacturing-with-ai-and-generative-ai-xmpros-intelligent-business-operations-suite/) by [Pieter van Schalkwyk](https://xmpro.com/author/pietervs/)![](https://xmpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Revolutionizing-Manufacturing-with-AI-and-Generative-AI-XMPros-Intelligent-Business-Operations-Suite\_-1024x576.png)

The manufacturing industry is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the emergence of generative AI (GenAI). [McKinsey & Co research](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/how-manufacturings-lighthouses-are-capturing-the-full-value-of-ai) shows that Industry leaders leveraging AI to power their Industry 4.0 transformations are at the forefront of this revolution. These innovative organizations are achieving remarkable results, including two to three times increase in productivity, 50 percent improvement in service levels, 99 percent reduction in defects, and 30 percent decrease in energy consumption.&#x20;

**Composability Makes Time To AI Value Faster**&#x20;

One of the key strategies employed by industry leaders is the concept of “assetization,” which involves packaging AI use cases for speed and scale of deployment in a [composable architecture](https://xmpro.com/compose-solutions-at-scale/) approach. By leveraging composable or modular design principles, investing in deployment productivity tools, and including digital upskilling materials as part of the asset package, these leaders are democratizing AI technology to subject matter experts that can apply it to various use cases.  This approach empowers engineers and technicians to identify, deploy, and test new AI applications, leading to significant improvements in efficiency and quality. &#x20;

As industry leaders progress towards system-level automation, they are building trust in AI models through closed-loop feedback, integration of safeguards and monitoring mechanisms, and phased deployment alongside human operators. This iterative process ensures that AI recommendations are reliable and accurate, paving the way for true automation. &#x20;

**XMPro Operationalize AI in Business Processes**&#x20;

XMPro, a leading provider of intelligent business operations solutions, is at the forefront of this AI-driven transformation in manufacturing.
