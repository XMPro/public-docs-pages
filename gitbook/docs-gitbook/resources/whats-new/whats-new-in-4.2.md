### Recommendation and Alert Scoring

When setting up a Recommendation, authors are now able to fine-tune the Alert Recommendation priority by changing its score. By contrast, Alert Ranking only has options for High, Medium, and Low.

Alert Scores are calculated based on these factors:

* [**Recommendation**](../../how-tos/recommendations/manage-recommendations.md#create-a-recommendation) [ ](../../how-tos/recommendations/manage-recommendations.md#create-a-recommendation)-  The importance of the recommendation itself
* [**Recommendation Category**](../../how-tos/manage-categories.md#adding-a-new-category)  - The importance of the recommendation's category
* [**Recommendation Rule**](../../how-tos/recommendations/create-rules.md#create-rules) -  The importance of the specific rule
* [**Recommendation Optional**](../../how-tos/recommendations/create-rules.md#create-rules)- Additional Rule Factor value retrieved from the Data Stream.&#x20;

As a recommendation creator, assigning a score to an alert lets you control its importance level more precisely. This Score helps the alert recipient to understand its relative importance.

### Viewing the Alerts

You can view the order of alerts in the Recommendation Alerts list.

You can also view the Scores using the Score Factor Matrix. Follow the steps mentioned [here](../../concepts/recommendation/recommendation-scoring.md#viewing-the-recommendation-scoring).
