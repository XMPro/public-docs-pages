## The Business Drivers

Posted on [April 28, 2010](https://xmpro.com/the-business-drivers/) by [Pieter van Schalkwyk](https://xmpro.com/author/pietervs/)

There are 6 business value drivers identified by Jack Alexander in his book [Performance Dashboards and Analysis for Value Creation](https://www.amazon.com/Performance-Dashboards-Analysis-Creation-Finance/dp/0470047976) that are under managementâ€™s control to influence:

1\. Sales Growth

2\. Relative Pricing Strength

3\. Operating Effectiveness

4\. Capital Management

5\. Cost of Capital

6\. Intangibles, Credibility, Future Expectations

These business value drivers can be influenced through a pro-active performance management approach. Improving the business performance can be achieved through a number of mechanisms both hard and soft in the organisation. Business processes are one of the tangible mechanisms that can easily be addressed to impact business performance. Pro-active process management impact most of the value drivers in a direct fashion. It can influence sales growth, drive and manage operating effectiveness, assist with capital management and manage intangibles.

I will address the concept of effective performance management through business process management in future posts.
