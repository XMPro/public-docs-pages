The increasing complexity of modern manufacturing systems poses significant challenges. Automation, robotics, AI, and IoT integration require advanced technical skills and continuous learning. Effective data management and analysis are essential for process optimization and decision-making. Additionally, achieving interoperability among various systems and technologies, managing global supply chains, and maintaining high-quality control standards _**demand a shift towards more sophisticated and knowledge-intensive work practices.**_

Let’s explore each of these in more detail.

### Driver 1 – Navigating the Shift: Addressing Labor Challenges in Manufacturing and Logistics <a href="#ember278" id="ember278"></a>

The evolving landscape of manufacturing and logistics is driving a significant shift in the required skill sets for frontline workers. Due to labor shortages, industry analysts project that by 2028, there will be more smart robots than frontline workers in these industries. This transition applies to physical and digital robots or agents that will augment the manufacturing workforce.

#### 1. Labor Challenges and Statistics <a href="#ember280" id="ember280"></a>

According to analyst research, labor has become as significant a constraint on operational performance as product availability. _**The U.S. workforce is expected to grow nearly five times slower than the U.S. GDP over the next decade**_, with the GDP projected to grow at 2.5% while the overall workforce will grow only 0.5%. **Specifically, manufacturing and retail workforces are expected to shrink by 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively.**

#### 2. Aging Workforce <a href="#ember282" id="ember282"></a>

**By 2030, the U.S. Department of Labor expects that one-quarter of the U.S. workforce will be over 65 years of age.** This trend is also evident in Europe and parts of Asia, indicating a global challenge. _**Manufacturing faces an image problem, with many younger generations perceiving these jobs as outdated, boring, and lacking creativity.**_ This negative perception and the widespread labor shortage make it challenging to attract and recruit new talent to fill the positions left by retirees.

#### 3. Declining Labor Participation Rates <a href="#ember284" id="ember284"></a>

U.S. labor participation rates are projected to decline from 67% in 2000 to 60.4% in 2030. This decline increases the labor shortages faced by various industries. LNS Research found by comparing 2019 vs. 2023 manufacturing employment data that there is a declining workforce tenure: _**The average tenure of employees in manufacturing has decreased from 20 years in 2019 to only three years in 2023.**_ This means that manufacturers are dealing with a less experienced workforce.

#### 4. Evolving Skill Requirements <a href="#ember286" id="ember286"></a>

The rapid pace of technological change in manufacturing means that the required skills constantly evolve. This makes finding candidates with the right expertise challenging and necessitates continuous upskilling and training efforts.

_Retaining these upskilled workers is a further challenge in this competitive labor market._ LNS further found in their comparison of 2019 and 2023 labor statistics that there is a high employee turnover: _**50% of new employees leave manufacturing roles within the first 90 days. The 90-day retention rate in 2019 was 90%.**_

This turnover rate further exacerbates the issue of a less experienced workforce and puts additional pressure on manufacturers to improve onboarding and training processes.

### Driver 2 – Rethinking Efficiency: Addressing the Productivity Plateau in Manufacturing <a href="#ember290" id="ember290"></a>

Despite significant advancements in IoT and automation, manufacturing productivity has not seen substantial improvements in recent years. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, labor productivity in the manufacturing sector, measured as output per hour for all workers, has plateaued.
