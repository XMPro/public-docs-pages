<summary>Transcript</summary>in this video we will look at how to

manage recommendation access

if you go to the recommendation

management area

you will see a list of all the

recommendations which either you have

created or you have been given access to

there are two levels of access for

recommendation

design time and run time design time

access basically means

users who are allowed to come in and

configure this recommendation

you can see i'm the owner at the moment

if i would like to invite other people

i can share this recommendation with

them by selecting their name

and then giving them a certain level of

permission

if i give them read access they will be

able to come in have a look at the

config of the recommendation and the

rules

but they will not be able to make any

change

but if i give them right access they

will be able to make a change

and modify the recommendation as they

may need however they can still

not delete the recommendation and they

cannot share the recommendation further

with other users

the last level of access is the co-owner

if i assign someone a co-owner

then they have as much rights on this

recommendation as much

the owner does

now if i go to the run access you will

see i have a list of all the users

along with the business areas or the

roles they belong to

your administrator can create any

hierarchy over here as required by the

business

that is done in the subscription manager

but over here i can choose a certain

person

or a group of people who can have the

runtime access to this recommendation

runtime access means that the user will

be able to see

the alerts which are filed against that

recommendation

in this grid

an important point to note is if you

have design time access

even if you are the owner does not mean

that you will be able to see the alerts

which are fired against that

recommendation

which is only reserved for people who

have run time access for the

recommendation

so that is how you manage access for

recommendations
