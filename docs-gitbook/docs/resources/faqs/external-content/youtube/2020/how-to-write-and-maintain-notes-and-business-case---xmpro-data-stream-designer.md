<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to another training video from

XM pro today we will be looking at how

to write and maintain notes and business

case notes can be found in the command

bar of your use case notes are used for

recording technical information about

the use case that you want to document

for when somebody comes into the use

case and wants to know something

technical about it in the future there

is an HTML editor here so you can enter

any notes that you need you can change

the font size you can add images links

videos business case on the other hand

is used to help organizations identify

why they are using this use case or

application they are typically written

before you start to create the use case

and they quantify the financial impact

and establish a baseline of the use case

so when you or someone else comes back

later to the use case and asks what is

this thing they can see oh yes this is

why we did it and this is the value

gained from it so business process

relates to the larger business process

in your organization for instance

predictive maintenance for a vision

inspection system the expected return on

income is pretty self-explanatory how

quickly will you get the money back that

you spent on this the business case is

the high level reason why you are

creating this use case so quality

monitoring for the visual inspection

system the type of value created can be

selected from this list we have improved

asset performance increased revenue

reduced costs reduced risk improved

customer service and for this case it

would be reduced costs and currency is

the currency that you are working with

the economic value add for annum is what

is the expected value you are going to

get out of this so for example three

million dollars

oops the NPV or net present value can be

calculated from a financial calculator

and if your accountants are interested

in this then they can they can give you

a number for this for example two

million four hundred thousand and the

business case text is a larger area for

you to define your business case so I've

got something here arrow six to improve

production and the vision inspection

system captures defects and every 1%

increase in first-pass yield delivers

five hundred thousand annual cost

savings and the potential savings for

this financial year is three million

dollars so you would save this and then

you would create your use case and then

in six months maybe there's a new

manager and they want to know why this

way this use case was created so you can

go back into the business case and you

can say this was created because we

wanted to add quality monitoring with

the vision inspection system and we

spent 2.4 million upfront and the

economic value add was three million

dollars and this is why we did it this

has been how to write and maintain notes

and business case
