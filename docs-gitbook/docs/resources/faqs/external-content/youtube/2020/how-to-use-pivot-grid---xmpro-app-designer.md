how to configure a pivot grid

we will start with the appearance

settings first we have an option for

visible here we can set it to true or

false and that will

enable or disable the control from being

viewed

showing borders will show a border

around the outside of the grid itself

row and column grand totals they will

show

on the column or row labels themselves

you can expand that to see some totals

and the same thing goes for the row and

column totals here

on to the behavior section we have three

options

we have an option to allow sorting by

summary

we can allow the end user to filter

and we can choose to retain the layout

the last options we have here fields

each field we can set it to

four different options let's create a

new one we have to give it a name we'll

call this

test we can choose rather to have the

row or column be visible

we can set a caption on it so we can

replace the name with a caption here i'm

just going to call it test again

you can choose where it's going to show

up in the pivot grid

it can be a row a column a piece of data

or filter you can choose the

data field itself you can choose one

something from your data source here

in this case i will choose order total

and the data type

i'll choose string data type as well you

have options right here

area i'm going to go with data in this

case

i'm going to set it to expanded expanded

means

that there's more data to see other than

just one you can expand it and see all

the data pieces

that go into the area you can set the

width

for the column or row as well

you can choose rather to wrap the words

transitioning to the live view here we

can see that we have

rows for our locations

we have columns for our customer then in

the data portion

we have some data

that's pivoted off these two sets of

values here

additionally we can see the grand totals

for the columns and the rows

and we can filter what rows we want what

fields we want

what should be a filter etc so if we

take we want to add the customer as well

want to move it to let's say the data

field

you can see that the pivot grid can be

updated in real time here we can move

this to a row

we can expand this and see

the drill down here as well
