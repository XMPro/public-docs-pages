<summary>Transcript</summary>hi and welcome to another training video

from XM pro today we'll be looking at

how to use the box and the data repeater

box components as a prerequisite for the

second part of the video on the Dodger

repeater box you should have already

gone through the video on how to create

and use data sources if you haven't done

that I recommend you do that first

however the first part of the video

doesn't require this the box is the

simplest component but it will be the

one that you're using the most you can

find the Box component in the layout

section of the blocks items inside the

box component that can expand will

automatically expand and evenly

distribute themselves to fill the

available space so if you put multiple

to like this you can see how it works

this is because it has Flex container

enabled on it and flex grow one if you

want to know more about how to modify

the layout sales on the Box watch the

video on how to use flex layout the data

repeater box is used for displaying

content from a data source on the page

you can attach a data source to the box

and it will repeat itself and its

contents for each row in the data source

this will give every item inside of it a

list of the columns of the data source

in their dynamic values when the data

repeater repeats it will display the

rows value of the selected column data

repeaters will evenly-spaced themselves

in the container box so if you want to

make them a set height you need to set

Flex grow to 0 then there will appear on

top of each other and this is how it

looks for each row in the data source it

is displaying a new data repeater box

with the dynamic values of the items

inside showing the corresponding data in

the row this has been how to use the box

and the data repeater box
