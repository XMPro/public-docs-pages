<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to another training video from

exam pro today we'll be looking at how

agent connect arrow behaves in data

stream designer

over here i already create a data stream

with free difference agent

a event simulator an australia action

engine and an

event printer when we connect to

different engines

if the target agents require a input

mechanism

the arrows will highlight in orange

that indicate there's a missing input

mapping in there

if the target agent does not require a

input mapping for example the infrared

printer

they will the arrow color will remain in

blue

once you configure the input mappings

the arrow color will change it back to

brew

the administrator of data stream

designer can disable the

error highlighting features from the

settings

so if you go to settings there's

settings called disable input highlights

so what we're going to do is switch it

on

going back to the screen

adding another

secret action agent

and when we connect to it the arrow will

be

remaining blue color and this is how

asian connect iris behaves in data

stream designer

thank you for watching
