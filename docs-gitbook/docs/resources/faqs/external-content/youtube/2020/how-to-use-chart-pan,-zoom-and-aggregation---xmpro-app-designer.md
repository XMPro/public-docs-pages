<summary>Transcript</summary>hi and welcome to another training video

from xmpro

this is an advanced video on how to use

the chart

specifically around panning zooming and

aggregation

i have here a chart with a lot of data

points

i would like to be able to zoom to get

more detail

to do this you can go to appearance

in the block properties and then check

enable pan and zoom

this will create a bar at the top and if

you scroll up

then it will zoom in

and if you scroll down it will zoom out

you can pan by clicking on the bar in

the top

and moving it left or right

now as you can see some of these points

are very close together

and we might not want to get all of

these points

as it will slow the chart down

to deal with this you can use

aggregation

aggregation is applied per series so go

into the series settings

and then go down to aggregation and

choose one of the aggregation

formulas average will average out the

points in a given range

count will count the number of entries

in a given range

max will get the maximum value in a

given range

min will get the minimum value and some

will add up all the values

this could be useful for bar charts i'm

going to choose average

and then apply save and launch

and now as you can see the dots are

separated by a specific amount

for each and they will be averaging all

the points

that appear between them so if i zoom in

on this little section here as soon as i

zoom in more than a certain amount

it gets more of the points

and then if i zoom in even more it'll

get more points

and if i zoom in even further

then you'll be able to see that these

points here

go up and then down and then up and then

down but if i scroll

scroll out a little bit more the points

are all flat

as it is averaging out the starter

so you do lose a little bit of fidelity

in exchange for

more performance this has been how to

use the chart

pan zoom and aggregation
