<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to another training video from

exam pro

today we're looking at audit chart and

how to enable or disability

in app designer or data stream designer

to enable or disable dolly trial first

you need to log on as administrator of

the application

if you want to check if you are the

administrator of the application you can

simply look at the top right hand corner

and you should see administrator under

your name

so for example if you want to enable

audit 12

in data stream designer you can go to

the settings

and you will see enable audit trial

option in here

if you want to enable it simply shrink

it's true if you want to disable it

bring it to false

and you will see the similar settings in

app designer

once you enable the audit trial or the

transaction that the user make will be

saved into the application database

if the user find any issue on

use case or recommendation and they want

to see the transaction at any point in

time

they can ask the administrator to

retrieve it from the application

database

and this is how you enable or disable

audit child in application designer or

data stream designer

thank you for watching
