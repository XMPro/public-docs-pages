<summary>Transcript</summary>when using app designer you may want to

make copies of your apps to modify

and use in other situations this video

will show you how to export

import and clone applications to

accomplish this

i have a pre-existing application here

that i would like to export

it has a data source and a page with

some items and page integrations

to export go to the app management blade

and click the export command

this will bring up a dialog box asking

if you would like to include any

sensitive settings from your

app data connections like passwords

normally these settings are encrypted so

they cannot be read but choosing to

include the settings will store them in

the file as readable text

choosing to exclude the sensitive

settings will not save them at all and

you will need to reconfigure your

connections

after you have imported the app so that

they will still work

clicking cancel will cancel the export

once you have selected include or

exclude

the file will be downloaded to your

computer

to import the file we have go to the app

list blade and click import

here upload the file that was downloaded

if you upload a file that was exported

without being deleted

or a file that has already been imported

app designer will notice that it already

exists and notify you

if you have at least write permission to

that app you will have the option to

import the file as a new version of the

existing app

i don't want to do this so i will choose

to import as a new application

altogether

this is the default option if the app

does not already exist or if you have

or if you do not have right permission

to the existing app

the import process will allow you to

assign a name description and category

to the imported app

when you are done click save this will

import the app with the connections

pages and page data intact with you as

its owner

if you try to import an app that uses

connectors that have not been uploaded

to the app designer

you'll be shown an error page you should

upload the missing connectors and

versions

or ask your company's administrator to

do so before trying to import again

exporting and importing is useful for

saving a file to import

a different installation of app designer

or to give to someone else to use

but if you want to copy an existing app

for yourself you can clone it to skip a

lot of steps

go to the app management blade and click

the clone button give the app a new name

and select the version to copy then

select ok

a brand new cup of the app with you as

its owner will be created

this has been how to export import and

clone an app in the app designer

thank you for watching
