<summary>Transcript</summary>what we are going to do here is look at

how to set up and configure the window

transformation agent

this agent allows for data to buffer for

an allocated amount of time before it is

pushed further along the stream

i already have an event simulator agent

setup and configured

which will simulate the number of

readings coming from sensors

i also have an event printer agent setup

which will help us see what the data

looks like when we are running our

stream

go to the toolbox and search for window

you will find it under transformations

click on the agent and drag it to the

canvas

connect the output endpoint of the event

simulator agent to the input endpoint of

the window agent

and the output endpoint of the window

agent to the input endpoint of the event

printer agent

note that a default name has been

assigned to your window agent

to rename this agent click on the white

space and start typing

click somewhere else on the canvas and

click save

double click on your window agent

this is where you will be configuring

your agent

first make sure you're using the correct

collection

if not select another collection from

the drop-down
