<summary>Transcript</summary>hello and welcome to another training

video from Exim Pro today we'll be

looking at how to use page layers page

layers is another sometimes simpler way

to modify elements on your page the page

layers can be found to the right of the

tabs on your command bar the usual way

of modifying the elements on the page is

to hover over the element you want to

change and then clicking on it or

dragging it around this stops working so

well when you have elements on top of

other elements and you can no longer

find a way to click on them properly for

example if I want to make the vertical

banner move over to the right if I try

to move it was dragging it will leave

elements I couldn't see behind this is

what the page layers is for in the page

layers you can see the hierarchy of

every element on the page you can expand

and collapse different sections to see

into elements on the hierarchy this will

not change the page in any way the

number on the right shows the number of

children elements inside of this element

for example this box has three elements

inside of it one two three you can click

on a specific element and it will select

the element within the page you can drag

an element around by clicking and

dragging the handle on the right and it

will rearrange itself in the page this

is how I would get this banner over to

the right I would drag over the Box

element and drag it to the other side

you can rename each element this will

not affect the runtime view of the page

but it will change the text if it

appears when you offer over an element

and finally you can press the I on the

left to hide and show elements be

careful as this will hide the elements

on the runtime view as well this is

how to use the page layers
