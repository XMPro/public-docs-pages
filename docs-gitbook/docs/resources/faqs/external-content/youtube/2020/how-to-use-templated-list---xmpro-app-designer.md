<summary>Transcript</summary>hi and welcome to another training video

from xm pro

today we will be looking at how to use

the templated list component

as a prerequisite you should have

already gone through the video on how to

create and use data sources

if not then i recommend doing that first

the templated list component can be

found in the layout section of the

blocks

to start with you should assign a data

source to the templated list

you do not need to assign any data

bindings on

the templated list itself but you must

bind any items inside the template that

you wish to have the values

so for instance this text item here

i will bind the text to name and these

other ones i'll set a static text

as static text

and this third one i don't want it so

i'm going to just delete it

you can add anything inside of these

templates so

any other controls widgets

anything you would like and they will

show up one per each row

and this is how it looks in the renderer

so for each row we've got the name which

was bound to this text

component and static text as

the text component over here and you can

select each row

as it is list

if you you can also enable search and

assign a

search by expression so this one i will

choose name

and if you enable grouping then it will

create a group

template and the group by expression

will group the items by like values in

this column

you can also allow collapsing and

expand by default so

if i allow collapsing that means that

you can click on the group header

and it will collapse or expand

and if you check expand by default then

they will all be

expanded and if you don't then they will

all be collapsed

to start with you also need to bind any

items

in the header so this text i'm going to

bind it

to group you can't select any other item

except for

the group by expression

so if i save this and then launch

we've got some groups here consultants

and developers

and we also have the search

so that's in developer david

some other properties you can add to

this is

visible disabled tooltip

which are self-explanatory tulip tooltip

is when you hover

and you can also add you can also check

select multiple which will allow you to

select multiple rows there's also the

action so you can navigate to specific

pages or urls

and you can also update data sources

if you want more information on this you

can go to the specific videos

on pages and navigation

and updating data sources

so now if i hover over you can see

there's the hovered over text

and there's now a checkbox so we can

select multiple items here

this has been how to use the templated

list component
