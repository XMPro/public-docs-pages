<summary>Transcript</summary>app files

in this video we will be looking at how

to maintain

application files and assets which can

be used within

a given app so if you look at

the design view of a given app you would

notice that you have a list of pages and

a few other options

if you go to the more menu there is an

option for app

files clicking on which will

bring you to this file manager where you

can maintain

the files and assets for this app

you will notice it has a tree view over

here

where you can create any sort of

directory structure

that you may need to better organize

your files

so if i wanted to create a new directory

i simply need to say

the name and the directory will then be

added

similarly i have an option to upload a

file

for example if i select a file it gets

added over there

and then i can use it within my app

similarly you have some more options

once you select a file

um or click on the three dots um which

are if you want to move it into a given

folder

you want to copy a file rename or delete

all those options are available and of

course you can download them as well

so one thing to note here is that this

is a design time view

as you as you can see we are in the

design time view of the app

um similarly this is the design time

view of the files and assets that are

available in the app

any changes you make here are version

controlled

same as the app so if i'm in the version

2 of my app

any changes i make here will belong to

version 2 of the app

and other versions will be unchanged

similarly if you export or clone your

app

the files will come with the version

lastly the files are common to all the

pages in a given version

so it doesn't matter which page you are

on you will be able to use

the same file and that has been defined

here

so another way to get to the same file

manager

is from within a page let's say i am on

this page

and i have a control which uses a file

selector

as you can see over here i have these

files available

but in case i wanted to add a file which

is missing

i can simply click on plus and i will be

able to quickly go to the same view

and make some changes and adjustments it

will then be reflected here

to learn more on how we use the ad files

with different controls

please look at the videos on d3 or unity

controls
