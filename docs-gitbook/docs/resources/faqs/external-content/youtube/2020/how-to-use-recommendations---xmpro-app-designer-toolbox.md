<summary>Transcript</summary>the recommendations bloc is used to

display a list of unresolved alerts for

one or more recommendations with the

ability to filter by the entity ID of

those alerts it gives you a detailed

overview of the health of your assets

with the ability to drill down further

for further details to begin drag the

recommendations block onto the page when

the page is launched this will display a

list of all open recommendation alerts

along with the scroll bar the list gets

too long you can also filter which

recommendations are displayed by

selecting them here deselecting all

recommendations will cause all

recommendations to be displayed which is

the best method of doing so as it will

automatically include recommendations

created after the page is designed you

can further filter alerts based on the

entity ID to do so select the page

parameter or variable to compare against

this is especially helpful when

designing a detailed sub page for your

assets as it allows you to narrow down

the displayed alerts to those generated

by or describing the asset will launch

the page now I'll enter an entity idea

that I know is found in the

recommendations as an example it would

normally come from a page parameter or

other user input this is the

recommendation list with no filtering

showing alerts from all recommendations

this is the list that is only filtered

by recommendation and this is the list

filtered by recommendation and entity ID

you can see that only recommendation

alerts for Bea - 0:08 are displayed we

are able to click into a recommendation

to view it in further detail but this

screen is covered in another video this

has been a demonstration of the

recommendations Block in app designer
