<summary>Transcript</summary>hi and welcome to another training video

from Exim Pro today we'll be looking at

how to use the field set and field

components the field set is the easiest

way to create a form on the page without

too much hassle the field set and field

can be found in the layout section of

the blocks a field set contains three

fields inside of it and you can drag in

more the layers of a field set are as

follows we have the field set container

and then we have fields and inside the

fields we have a label and a value and

you can double click on the label to

rename it or you can go into the block

properties and rename it in appearance

or give it a dynamic value here with a

data source if you have one of those on

the field set the value is ready-made so

that when you drag something like a text

box inside it will automatically fit to

what you have there you can drag in

color selectors date selectors drop-down

grids number selectors we're running out

of room here

so I'll drag in some more fields

you

and I can duplicate these which will

make it easier all right you can also

drag in range sliders

select boxes switches tags text areas

and of course we also had the we already

had the text box at the start any of

these components will fit properly into

the field set and then if we launch it

we can see how this looks so we've got a

bunch of fields and then it's lining up

the components that we've dragged into

here in a way that makes it look good on

the page this has been how to use the

field set and field components
