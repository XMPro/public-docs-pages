<summary>Transcript</summary>the stacked layout blocks are used to

subdivide your page or section into

smaller rows or columns it can be used

to provide structure to the entire page

or as a table to organize similar

information into a presentable format

this example will be Crowley concerned

with the vertical layout this will

create three identical rows that will

fill the available space I'll add some

gray boxes to the rows to help

illustrate the horizontal layout is

exactly the same and has identical

properties save that it divides the

given area into columns instead of rows

to add segments select a row and click

the plus button on the blue control bar

which will add a row at the bottom you

can also drag existing boxes into the

vertical layout where they will be added

or rearrange existing ones columns are

equally sized by default and will resize

to fit any new columns added to change

their relative widths open the block

styling tab expand the Flex layout

section and inspect the Flex growth

value this value determines the size of

each column relative to one another and

then fits them all into the available

space for instance a block with the

growth value of two will always be

double the size of a block with a value

of 1 in the same stack layout no matter

how many blocks occupy the layout or how

large it happens to be at the moment the

growth value is not actually applied to

any of the box when they are first

created despite there being a value here

which caused which causes the overall

feature to malfunction to fix this the

growth value must be reset individually

for each box in the layout you can nest

stacked layouts within each other to

further organize your page and of course

the horizontal layout has all the same

behaviors and options as the vertical

layout I'll add some darker gray boxes

to these adding and removing as well as

flex growth this has been a

demonstration of the layout grid in app

designer
