<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to another training video from

example today we're looking at app

designer variables

so let's get started in app designer

variable can be used for capturing the

user input

or you can use variable to calculate or

transform the data using the inspection

over here i already create a simple app

that contains two pages

the landing page to capture the new

customer details in the other page to

display

all the new customer to now

we're going to type the first name and

last name

and hit the submit button then we'll

navigate to the customer list

as you can see there's no new customer

being inserted because

there's no variable being set up yet

now we're going to add invert and see

how we can achieve that

to add a variable you can go to the page

data tab

of the page and click the pass button

right here

now give namely a new variable

and we can choose the data type we keep

it in a string

and you can see there's two modes of

variable

one is failure once an expression and

witness we direction before

the expression is useful to calculate or

transform the data

so we keep it as value

another one for last name

now we're going to bind those variables

to the values of the textbox

and now we're going to add a new action

to

ancestors new information to database

let me choose insert in here and add a

new

override frame values

again you choose the variable from here

and now we're going to show you the

changes in action

so let's type the

and name the submit button

now we see the new customer drone there

is being inserted into the database

now i'm going to show you

um the expression of variables

in this app we have two text box

and one text block to show the result

so in here just add two numbers in here

so type five and four

you see we show line so now we're going

to show you how we configure that

in the page data you see there's three

variables

the first two is value and the result is

expression

you see we have adding two variable

together variable one plus variable two

and this is variable in after design

thank you for watching
