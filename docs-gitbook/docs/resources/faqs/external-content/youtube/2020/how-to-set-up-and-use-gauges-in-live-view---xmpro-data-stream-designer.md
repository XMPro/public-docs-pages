<summary>Transcript</summary>welcome to another training video from

XM pro today we will be looking at how

to set up and use the gauge in the live

view as a prerequisite you should go

through the video on how to setup and

use the live view first before watching

this video I have here set up a use case

with an event simulator that is creating

one event every second with an a value

between 0 and 100 to change the live

date of view to a gauge you must click

on the edit button change the type to a

gauge and then down the bottom choose

your value which is value and a sub

value which I will choose the same this

is the sub value is not required but the

value is and we'll set this value

indicator to a triangle needle and the

sub value indicated to the triangle

marker then we can save and as you can

see every time it gets new data the

gauge reflects this new value because I

have set the values to generate a random

number from 0 to 100 the automatic start

and end values fit but if you have a

different range than you can set these

values to something else this won't go

on the left side because the values

generated won't reflect that you can

choose a label format from currency

fixed point % etc what this does is

change how the label looks so if I say

currency and then save now it's zero

dollars to $100 or if I say exponential

and it's the mathematical exponential

number

I'll keep this as currency for now

you can add value ranges so zero that's

zero to 20 and then 20 to 80 and then 80

to 100 and this colors the gauge

different colors on each section you can

choose the tick intervals so the major

tick interval is where the labels are so

I can set that to 10 and then the minor

tick interval I can set to 5 so 5 10 15

20 etcetera and then we have the types

of indicators so a triangle needle looks

like this and the triangle marker is a

little triangle on the bar itself you

can also do a text cloud which displays

the number displays the value so 39 22

etc and that is replaced the sub value

indicator so we don't get the triangle

anymore if there's also a rectangular

needle which is similar to the triangle

needle but it's rectangular and there's

a range bar which goes around the inside

if you choose different values for your

your data then it won't always be the

same here

it may have let's say 20 goals on the

main value indicator and the sub value

indicator could be somewhere else as I

don't have more than one value I can't

show this this has been how to set up

and use the gauge in the live view
