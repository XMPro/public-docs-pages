<summary>Transcript</summary>in this video we'll go over how to set

the buffer size and what it means to set

it to a different number

to get to the buffer size navigate to

properties of the stream

and scroll down till you get to your

buffer size here

you can set it to any number between 128

and 10

and 240 kilobytes

once you change the size of your buffer

you can save it

you'll get a prompt here you can say no

or yes

now the stream next time it starts will

be ready

with its new buffer size

changing your buffer size means that

whenever messages are sent from one

agent

to the next that will be the max

possible message size in this case 128

kilobytes as a message size

or the total accumulated messages

that an agent can receive at any given

moment

can't exceed this number plus

one message
