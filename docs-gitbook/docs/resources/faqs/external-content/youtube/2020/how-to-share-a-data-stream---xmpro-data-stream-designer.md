<summary>Transcript</summary>hi and welcome to another training video

from xm pro

today we will be looking at how to share

a use case

i have here a use case that i would like

to share

to do this click on the share button

and you can see that because i created

this use case i have the access granted

as

owner if you want to share this with

somebody else

press the add button then select the

user

user or users you would like to share

with

and then select the permission that you

would like to give them

so i'm just going to keep it as read for

now

and then press ok this has shared it

with these people

so i have a few use cases here that

somebody has shared with me this one i

have been shared

as a co-owner

which means that i can edit anything

i can share it with anybody else

and i can delete it

this one has been shared as write access

which means that i can edit anything

but i can't share it with anybody

and the last one i've been given right a

read access

which means that i can't edit anything

including notes

business case anything like that

if i try to type in here this is read

only

and also i can't share with anybody

to summarize what you can do with

different accesses i

i have this table

to edit or delete a use case you must

have write

owner or co-owner access to clone a use

case you can have any access

and then you will be the owner of this

newly newly cloned use case

you will also be the owner of a use case

if you add or import it

and you can only manage access if you

are an owner

or co-owner however you can always

delete your own

access this has been how to share a use

case
