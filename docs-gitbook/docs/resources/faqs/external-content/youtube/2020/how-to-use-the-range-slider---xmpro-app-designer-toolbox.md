<summary>Transcript</summary>hi and welcome to another training video

from XM pro today we will be looking at

how to use the range slider the range

slider is a control that can be found in

the basic section of the blocks the

range slider is a number based control

which has handles that you can drag up

and down a line there are two modes

range and point range has two sliders

and outputs two values end point has one

slider and only outputs one value you

can choose whether to show the blue line

on the range slider visibility is

self-explanatory you can choose whether

to show labels below or above the range

slider you can choose the label format

which has a large number of options here

for instance percent will change 0.5 to

50% and 0.99 to 99 percent or you can

just leave the label format blank and it

will just show the number there are

tooltips you can either show them on

hover or always the tooltip position can

be chosen top or bottom and the tooltip

format which is the same as the label

format in behavior we have the minimum

value so if I put that as negative 100

then you can see that zero is now in the

middle of the slider and a maximum value

both of these can be dynamic or static

values if you have a data source the

dynamic value will be chosen from

the from the column that you choose step

is to what nearest value the slider will

end up on so if I put 10 then drag it

around and it'll it'll jump to zero

it'll jump to ten and then it'll jump to

20 if I put this at 100 sorry if I drag

it to negative 51 it'll drag it to

negative 100 and if I drag it on to

negative 49 it'll drag it up to zero and

there's read-only and disabled which is

self explanatory this is the values you

can set the starting value so if I set

this to 50 now you can see that the

start value is on 50 and then if I put

75 the stop the end value will be on 75

in the range slider alternatively if you

choose point mode this there will only

be one value in here I need to save this

first if we launch here's the slider

negative 100 to 102 on so I drag it down

negative hundred snap and this is the

step the tooltip you can see when I'm

hovering over the value it's showing the

tooltip this is what I've chosen on

hover and that's about it this has been

how do you use the range slider
