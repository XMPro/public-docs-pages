{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-XEEKPeJag" %}

This is a short introduction to XMPro and it highlights how XMPro enables intelligent business operations in large and medium organisations.

It is based on a simple example that demonstrates the three key elements of intelligent business operations with process need to handle:

• unstructured routing based on rules rather than workflow • dynamic changes to external and internal contextual information • social collaboration in and around processes

Please contact us or one of our partners or more detailed demonstrations around our capability for SharePoint, Microsoft Outlook or mobile devices.

this is a short introduction video to

exm Pro and it highlights how exm Pro

enables intelligent business operations

in large and medium organization it is

based on a typical example that

demonstrates the three key elements of

intelligent business operations which

processors need to handle the first of

that being able to handle unstructured

routing which are rules-based rather

than workflow based so that is the

instance where there are no predefined

workflows typically the scenario of

knowledge workers where based on

contextual information you would decide

what the routing is which leads to the

next um point of intelligent business

operations the ability to handle Dynamic

changes uh to the process based on

internal and external contextual

information and then lastly being able

to uh manage and handle social

collaboration in and around

processes with structured workflow you

typically have a challenge where social

collaboration happens with email outside

of the process management solution and

with exm Pro we have built social

collaboration into the process and that

is how we enable intelligent business

operations through exm Pro this is the

web interface of exm pro it is Al also

available in SharePoint Microsoft

Outlook and also for mobile devices as

you can see we have multiple login

providers social providers so you can

log in with a Facebook account Twitter

LinkedIn some line of business

applications like sip if you're on

active directory it'll log you in

through your active directory

credentials but in this instance I'm

going to use a XM Pro username and

password based login so I'm going to log

in as Keith

Miller

and Keith needs to start the bid

management process within our

organization so there's a new bid

Control process uh this is for a large

scale tender and before we can do that

we actually need to put together a bit

committee there's certain business rules

that will dictate how how um the bid

will be put together and one of the

dynamic aspects of a bid is as we gather

more information some of the rules and

governance and compliance requirements

may change so in this instance just as a

uh from a reference point of view this

is the exm pro user interface these are

things that I can start these are my

to-do list task cases

schedules um tracking I can track either

processes that are in in progress or

completed and we have analytics and

dashboards as well showing the

performance of each of the processes if

you want more information on on XM Pro

contact us or one of our partners I'm

going to show you the bid request

process this is a typical form that is

designed inside XM Pro and it's got

Dynamic capability So based on

information in here this may change it

may add or remove certain buttons

so from a a dynamic and unstructured uh

point of view we are able to manage

unstructed

processes if you look at this is the web

interface so if you look at the design

environment the design environment is a

desktop application that can be used to

author on premise and XM Cloud so our

hosted Cloud environment XM Cloud uh to

to configure processes on on any of

those so in this in

I'm going to look at a at that same

process I'm going to look at the market

and sell and I'm going to look at

Opportunity management as you'll see

from our from our representation here

this model is

a there's no flows drawn between any of

this this is just a container the

container is opportunity management of

which bid management is the start of the

process the new bit Control process and

from there it can flow to any one of

these there are no pred defined flows so

we have a collection of events and I can

add new events to that in this design

environment without having to build

complex uh routing logic we have Dynamic

allocation logic which will

automatically assist you to rout

functionality in a in order to do uh

quite a number of things I'm going to

start opportunity for a new company

called Osco we are we would like to um

tender on that and in this instance what

you'll see is at the moment it doesn't

force me to go to a bid committee if I

put in a value of

$10,000 you'll see that there's

still uh I still have the option to

manually do that uh the the business

rules say that if it's a new customer

there's a certain segment it's a new

technology and it's above a certain

value then then uh it will force me to

go to a bid committee if I change that

value to $50,000 $50,000 in this

example then it'll automatically all

force me to go to a bit committee it

doesn't say that I have to do it right

now but one of the governance and

compliance checks for this process will

be before I can complete the process

that it will be needed to or it'll need

to be submitted to a bid uh committee

dat so we'd like to submit that then and

information that we're going to update

back to our CRM is that we we think that

they are going to buy around about that

time uh opportunity assessment I can

attach documents these documents can be

stored in either SharePoint or your

document management system or in a file

based um solution and in this instance

I'm just going to the the standard exm

profile uh filebase Solutions in this

instance I'm just going to upload the

assessment that we have done uh for Osco

so that's one of the documents I can

have additional supporting documents and

I can add additional line items as you

can see so we can have Header

information line information uh multiple

lines you can add and remove I'm not

going to add any right there I can

have questions that need to be completed

uh in order for this to happen so as you

can see I've uploaded a document and in

this instance I'm going to send it I

have contextual information I've heard

something around Osco on the news and I

just want to have a credit check before

we're going to spend all this money on

the setting up a a bid committee and all

that um so as a knowledge worker I am

not forced to go in a specific route I'm

just going to ask for credit check at

that point in time and as you'll see

it's now gone to the finance group so

there's three or four or five people in

this Finance group um that that can act

on this I'm going to log in as one of

the people in the finance group and once

again I'm just going to use the XM Pro

login and I know that Mark Smith uh

Works in that group so he's one of five

people in a finance

group so um it's under market and sale

products and services

if it's a large list of outstanding

tasks it's quite easy to filter and sort

um in in a large U numbers I I can have

a look at what was done so before I

accept this task for myself I can have a

look at the

history and I can see what was completed

in step

one and based on that I will assign it

to myself so now it removes it of the

rest of the people in that group and it

now now only sits with

me so as you can see from a dynamic

point of view at the moment this is not

reviewed so there's only one option on

the screen uh and from so from a

controll and governance point of view we

can we can still make sure that at

certain point only certain steps can

happen in this instance the $50,000 is

actually us and we want to convert from

US Dollars to Australian

dollars and we will use external web

service in this instance so it'll

convert the 50,000 to a uh using that

currency exchange rate from a web

service and that equal to

$47,000 which we need to submit to our

credit guys for credit approval before

we do that so as you can see it's not

reviewed yet I'm going to send it to a

credit uh service and they will come

back with a score uh once again that's

the external web service and that brings

back a score of 79 data integration can

be done through to any line of business

application that has got integration

capabilities um to external web services

to SharePoint lists so from an

integration point of view we have a

whole lot as you can see it's now also

changed this to a positive review so now

that the credit check has been done and

there's a positive review for this so I

can submit this and it'll now go

back to set up a bit committee this is

the next step that's recommended after

the step after the credit check has been

done and I will log in as one of the

people in the bid

committee so I know that

Tim is one of the bid committee

members and in his list of tasks to

do we

have the bid and it's come through from

Mark so once again if he wants to

see

um the history of that before I do that

I would actually just

like to have a conversation around this

so I'm just going to say

any

info on

Oz uh and the company was called

Osco and on Osco so this is a social

conversation that I'm starting I can do

it with a specific user that is part of

this bit committee group or I can just

send out uh does

anyone know of them and uh so this is a

message that is associated with this

process now having a look at this uh I

will assign it to myself so I can once

again see the history I can see how it

got to me so if I look at the history I

can see uh you can see there's the

conversation that I've just entered into

the process I can see how the from a

history perspective how it got to me and

I can say assign that so now this

activity sits with me and as you can see

this opens up a whole new screen with a

whole lot of features that that uh

supports intelligent business operations

we have covered how we handle

unstructured and dynamic routing options

in here um from a from a intelligent

business operations point of view you

want to enable knowledge workers to make

the best decision and take the next best

action that they can uh one of the

challenges that you find with

conventional systems is is that you

still have to go off to a third party

application to and look at your bi tools

to understand where you are with this um

intelligent business operations features

of of X and pro you can actually embed

the graphs right into your your your bi

information right into the step that I

need to do the the the step that I need

to take in here as you can see this is a

assessment of the opportunity uh the

current opportunity is that green one

over there so in terms of risk it's a

fairly lowrisk project and the

probability pretty high and that's the

value so this can dynamically change as

risk information gets entered into

another system this can move the bubble

around so you can see where this project

sit relative to other projects so as

soon as I looking at who I need to

assign this can have an impact on

resource scheduling uh which we'll cover

over there but there's still some more

information that I would like to have

before I make a decision ision and one

of those are looking at process goals so

in this

example um I can see that my current

sales budget I can see I'm why under in

terms of sales budget and this is the

funnel coming out of the external CRM

solution it can be uh on premise or

cloud-based uh information this can be

uh external web feeds it can be a a

Google or Bing map with superimposed

points in terms of where Vehicles might

be where um aircraft tracking or

whatever it is that you want in terms of

of process goals now process goals span

over a process where this is inside a

transaction so this is specific to the

step in the transaction and this will

span across every single person who is

part of this will drive to the same

outcomes or the same process goal so you

can set certain process goal parameters

in here so that's the those are two of

the components the last component that

we'd like to do is actually to have um

to look at what what is the next based

action so let's have a quick look at

this next based action in this example

we are actually just looking at the

number of times a certain process we

followed so on the right hand side we've

got legal review finance and recast and

we also look at based on these certain

these exact same conditions what did

people do with uh in in that specific

scenario so 17 people sent it for

recasting so uh you can build what

scenarios you can build a lot more

complex next next best actions you can

build your business GPS and advise

people uh what the next best action so

the combination of the next best action

the process goals and the inflight

analytics gives you an unbelievable

opportunity to advise people on their

actions you can do resource scheduling

out of XM Pro there's a whole number of

ways to build list this is for example

people uh in the existing system and

once again this is a typical uh example

of a intelligent form that you can build

with information from external services

and as you can see the green bubble in

this bubble chart part of the dynamic

component of what XM Pro does this is

really just a a short uh introduction in

terms of what it can do there's a whole

lot of other functionality and I really

suggest that you talk to um either

ourselves or one of our partners to see

some of the other functionality inside

XM pro thank you for your time
