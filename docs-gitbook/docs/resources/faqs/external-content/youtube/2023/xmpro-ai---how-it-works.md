a revolutionary platform transforming

data analysis and predictive modeling

let's dive in and discover how it works

we start our journey with Innovation and

augmentation in a familiar Jupiter

notebook environment

this comfortable playground is an ideal

space for data scientists and engineers

they can use pre-existing libraries and

python models accelerating the analysis

process

we Dive Right into synthetic data

creation

here we're generating data for a beer

quality prediction model using an

external Library numpy

however the flexibility of XM Pro AI

means that you can also import your own

data

now armed with our synthetic data we

turn to data analysis

chat GPT our augmentation partner steps

in helping us visualize a correlation

Matrix for precise data analysis

with this we create in test regression

models unraveling the stories our data

has to tell

our model is now ready to be fetched

inside a data stream

XM Pro AI is equipped to process

real-time data bringing the power of

embedded AI to your fingertips

simultaneously our ml flow interface

lets you choose and run various models

truly giving you the reins

as we journey deeper we arrive at the

heart of XM Pro ai's capabilities

embedded AI

we take real-time data apply our chosen

models and the insights are pushed into

a front-end digital twin application

now let's take a moment to dive into

this front-end application

imagine being able to interact with the

data in real time to generate

predictions or ask questions directly to

the application

see how easy it is to view and analyze

maintenance history

decide on the next steps and even create

a work order request for Mirror

but that's not all

XM Pro AI has a myriad of capabilities

and possibilities

want to run python directly

sure thing

want to analyze sensor data with

beautiful graphics

no problem

the XM Pro AI platform is continually

evolving to meet your data analysis

needs

XM Pro AI offers an end-to-end AI and

data analysis solution from synthetic

data generation and Analysis to

predictive modeling and real-time

application

with our platform the future of data

analysis is at your fingertips

XM Pro AI where data transforms into

action
