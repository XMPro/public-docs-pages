Demin Water Monitoring for Boiler Tube Corrosion Thermal power plants experience large generation losses due to boiler tube leaks. A failure of the demineralized water deaerators that heat feedwater and reduce oxygen is a major cause of boiler tube erosion/corrosion. Solution Monitor the demin water deaerators that remove the oxygen that lead to pit corrosion

<p>Thermal power plants experience large generation losses due to boiler tube leaks. A failure of the demineralized water deaerators that heat feedwater and reduce oxygen is a major cause of boiler tube erosion/corrosion.</p>
<h4><strong>Solution</strong></h4>
<p>Monitor the demin water deaerators that remove the oxygen that lead to pit corrosion on the boiler tubes. Operations are not always aware of the impact of deaeration on the tubes and often ignore these DCS alerts.</p>
<h4><strong>Benefits</strong></h4>
<p>Reduce losses due to boiler tube leaks. Improve collaboration between reliability engineering and operations.</p>
