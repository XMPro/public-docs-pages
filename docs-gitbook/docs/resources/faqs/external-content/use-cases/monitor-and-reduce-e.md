<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>In food manufacturing, energy costs constitute a significant portion of total operational expenses, presenting opportunities for cost reduction and enhanced competitiveness:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Energy Costs:</strong> A substantial part of operational costs in food manufacturing is attributed to energy usage.</li>
<li><strong>Inefficient Motor Drives:</strong> Variable speed drives (VSD) and other electric motor drives can become inefficient, leading to increased energy consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Without continuous monitoring, it’s challenging to identify and address energy inefficiencies.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Process Inefficiencies:</strong> Certain operational processes may lead to higher energy usage without optimized management.</li>
</ul>
