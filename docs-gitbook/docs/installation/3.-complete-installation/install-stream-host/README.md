# Install Stream Host

{% hint style="info" %}
**Want to run Stream Host in Docker?** Please jump to "[Docker instructions for Stream Host](docker.md)".
{% endhint %}

## Download the Connection Profile

Each Data Stream created in Data Stream Designer must belong to a [Collection](../../../concepts/collection.md). You can download the information in a Collection as a file, known as a Connection Profile. This profile includes the _device name, collection ID, server URL, secret,_ and _key_.

To simplify installing a Stream Host (also called a device), download the Connection Profile to avoid manually copying Collection details from Data Stream Designer to the installer.

To obtain a Connection Profile, follow the steps below.

1. [Log into Data Stream Designer](../../../administration/users/register-an-account.md) and open the _Collections_ page from the left-hand menu.
2. Select the Collection you wish to use. If there isnâ€™t a Collection available, you can [create one](../../../how-tos/data-streams/manage-collections.md) by clicking the _New_ button, choosing a name for the collection, and clicking _Ok_.
3. Click on _Connection Profile_.
4. Choose a name for the device.
5. Enter the File Key.
6. Click _Ok_. The Connection Profile will automatically begin to download.

## Troubleshooting

If your Stream Host is not appearing in a Data Stream Collection, follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. Check the Stream Host logs:
   * By default, the Stream Host writes logs to STDOUT on the platform where it's running.
   * Review these logs for details on why your Stream Host is unable to connect.
2. Configure additional logging:
   * For more detailed information, you can [configure additional logging](../configure-logging-optional.md#stream-hosts) for the Stream Host.
3. Verify Stream Host settings:
   * Ensure the Stream Host is properly configured with the correct endpoint and credentials.
4. Check system requirements:
   * Confirm that your system meets the minimum requirements for running the Stream Host.
5. Ensure accurate date and time settings:
   * Verify that the date and time on the Stream Host platform are exactly synchronized with the XMPro server time.
   * Even a one-minute discrepancy can cause authorization issues and prevent the Stream Host from connecting.
6. Common issues to look for:
   * Network connectivity problems
   * Incorrect configuration settings
   * Authentication issues
   * Time synchronization errors
7. If issues persist:
   * If you're still experiencing problems after checking these points, contact XMPro support for further assistance.
