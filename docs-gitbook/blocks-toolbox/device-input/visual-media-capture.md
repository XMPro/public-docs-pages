# Visual Media Capture

The Visual Media Capture Block enables users to capture a photo or a video or upload an existing media file. This is useful when composing Applications such as a mobile inspection app and the user may be required to include an image when logging an issue. &#x20;

## Visual Media Capture Properties

### Appearance

#### Common Properties

The _visibility_ property is common to most Blocks;

[See the Common Properties article for more details on common appearance properties.](../common-properties.md#appearance)

#### Capture Button Text

The text displayed on the capture button.

### Behavior

#### Common Properties

The _disabled_ property is common to most Blocks;

[See the Common Properties article for more details on common behavior properties.](../common-properties.md#behavior)

#### Allowed File Extensions

This allows you to specify the types of files that can be uploaded. If left blank, any file type can be uploaded.&#x20;

If a file extension is listed, (for example, a .png file), the Visual Media Capture will not allow you to upload any other file except those with a .png extension.

#### Max File Size

This setting dictates the maximum allowable file size for uploads. If you attempt to upload a file that exceeds the maximum size, it will not be uploaded.

#### Provider

The supported external cloud storage providers are Azure Blob or Amazon S3.

#### Use Variables

Tick to use variables for the provider-related properties.

#### Blob Connection String

The blob connection string (applies to the Azure Blob [Provider](visual-media-capture.md#provider) only).

#### Blob Container Name

The blob container name (applies to the Azure Blob [Provider](visual-media-capture.md#provider) only).

#### Access Key

The Amazon S3 access key (applies to the Amazon S3 [Provider](visual-media-capture.md#provider) only).

#### Secret Key

The Amazon S3 secret key (applies to the Amazon S3 [Provider](visual-media-capture.md#provider) only).

#### Bucket Name

The Amazon S3 bucket name (applies to the Amazon S3 [Provider](visual-media-capture.md#provider) only).

#### Region

The Amazon S3 region (applies to the Amazon S3 [Provider](visual-media-capture.md#provider) only).

### Value

#### Common Properties

The _value_ property is common to most Blocks;

[See the Common Properties article for more details on common value properties.](../common-properties.md#behavior-1)

We recommend using a dynamic value property so that when you upload media files, the URLs are bound to the value property, with enclosed brackets and comma-separated.

You can utilize a stored proc to save the file URLs into a data source and view them by adding the URL as a hyperlink to a Data Grid.&#x20;

```sql
// Sample code to populate the file URLs to a SQL table
CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[sp_MobileSpec_Update]  
(  
    @MobileId BIGINT,  
    @MediaArray NVARCHAR(MAX),  
    @UploadDate DATETIME2(7),  
    @UploadUser NVARCHAR(150)  
)  
AS  
BEGIN  
    SET NOCOUNT ON  
  
    IF (@MediaArray IS NOT NULL AND @MediaArray != '')  
    BEGIN  
        DECLARE @IDs TABLE (ID NVARCHAR(MAX)) -- Use NVARCHAR(MAX) to store URLs  
  
        -- Populate @IDs table with the result of dbo.SplitString function  
        INSERT INTO @IDs (ID)  
        SELECT Value FROM dbo.SplitString(@MediaArray, ',')  
  
        -- Iterate over each URL and insert into the table  
        DECLARE @ID NVARCHAR(MAX)  
  
        DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR  
        SELECT ID FROM @IDs  
  
        OPEN cur  
        FETCH NEXT FROM cur INTO @ID  
  
        WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0  
        BEGIN  
   DECLARE @LastSlashPosition INT = LEN(@ID) - CHARINDEX('/', REVERSE(@ID)) + 1  
   DECLARE @FileName NVARCHAR(MAX) = SUBSTRING(@ID, @LastSlashPosition + 1, LEN(@ID) - @LastSlashPosition)  
   SET @FileName = SUBSTRING(@FileName, CHARINDEX('/', @FileName) + 1, LEN(@FileName))  
            -- Process each URL here  
            INSERT INTO [MobileInspectionApp_AppFile] ([MobileInspectionAppId], [AppFileId], [UploadDate], [UploadUser], [URL])  
            VALUES (@MobileId, @FileName, @UploadDate, @UploadUser, @ID)  
  
            FETCH NEXT FROM cur INTO @ID  
        END  
  
        CLOSE cur  
        DEALLOCATE cur  
  
  UPDATE [MobileInspectionAppTest] SET [AppFileId] = 'Files attached' WHERE [Id] = @MobileId  
    END  
END
```

The _Validation Group and Required_ properties are common to most Blocks;

[See the Common Properties article for more details on common validation properties](../common-properties.md#validation).
