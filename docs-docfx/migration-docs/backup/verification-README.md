# DocFX Documentation Verification

This document explains the verification process for the DocFX documentation and provides instructions for running the verification scripts.

## Verification Scripts

The following verification scripts are available:

1. **verify-links.ps1**: Checks for broken internal links in the documentation.
2. **verify-images.ps1**: Checks for broken image links and images missing alt text.
3. **verify-navigation.ps1**: Checks the navigation structure of the documentation.
4. **verify-search.ps1**: Tests the search functionality of the documentation.

## Running the Verification Scripts

There are two ways to run the verification scripts:

### Option 1: Run Individual Scripts

You can run each verification script individually:

```powershell
cd docs-docfx
.\verify-links.ps1 -Port 8088
.\verify-images-fixed.ps1 -Port 8088 -MaxPagesToCheck 50 -TimeoutSeconds 60
.\verify-navigation.ps1 -Port 8088
.\verify-search.ps1 -Port 8088
```

### Option 2: Run All Verification Scripts

You can run all verification scripts at once using the `run-verification-fixed.ps1` script:

```powershell
cd docs-docfx
.\run-verification-fixed.ps1
```

This script will:

1. Start the DocFX server if it's not already running
2. Run all verification scripts
3. Generate a summary report
4. Update the migration plan to mark the verification step as complete

## Verification Issues and Fixes

### Issue with verify-images.ps1

The original `verify-images.ps1` script had an issue where it would get stuck in an infinite loop or take too long to complete. This was because it was trying to crawl the entire site without any limits on the number of pages to check or a timeout.

#### Fix

A new script called `verify-images-fixed.ps1` has been created with the following improvements:

1. Added a `MaxPagesToCheck` parameter to limit the number of pages to check
2. Added a `TimeoutSeconds` parameter to limit the time spent checking images
3. Added a `Port` parameter to specify the port of the DocFX server
4. Added progress reporting to show how many pages have been checked
5. Added a summary report at the end showing the number of pages checked, images found, broken images, and images missing alt text

### Issue with run-verification.ps1

The original `run-verification.ps1` script had an issue where it was trying to run the `verify-images.ps1` script with parameters that the script didn't support. It was also not properly handling the timeout for the script.

#### Fix

A new script called `run-verification-fixed.ps1` has been created with the following improvements:

1. Uses the new `verify-images-fixed.ps1` script instead of the original `verify-images.ps1` script
2. Properly passes parameters to each script
3. Provides better progress reporting
4. Generates a more detailed summary report

## Verification Results

The verification results are saved in the `verification-results` directory. The following files are generated:

1. **verify-links-transcript.txt**: Transcript of the verify-links.ps1 script
2. **verify-images-fixed-transcript.txt**: Transcript of the verify-images-fixed.ps1 script
3. **verify-navigation-transcript.txt**: Transcript of the verify-navigation.ps1 script
4. **verify-search-transcript.txt**: Transcript of the verify-search.ps1 script
5. **verification-summary.md**: Summary of the verification results

## Known Issues

### Search Functionality

The search functionality is not working correctly. When searching for "agent", it returns "No results for 'agent'" even though there should be content related to agents in the documentation. This issue has been noted in the migration plan and will need to be fixed before the final deployment.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the search functionality issue
2. Complete the styling and customization of the documentation
3. Perform a final review of the documentation
4. Deploy the documentation to GitHub Pages
