# Phase 6 Completion: Use Cases Migration

## Summary

Phase 6 of the Navigation Migration Plan has been successfully completed. This phase involved migrating all use cases content from GitBook to DocFX.

## What Was Accomplished

1. Created the necessary directory structure for use cases content:
   - Created the external-content directory in docs/resources/faqs/
   - Created the use-cases directory in external-content/

2. Migrated 38 use case files from GitBook to DocFX:
   - Each use case was copied with its original content
   - File names were sanitized to ensure compatibility with DocFX

3. Created navigation files:
   - Created toc.yml for the use-cases directory with entries for all use cases
   - Created index.md for the use-cases directory with links to all use cases
   - Created toc.yml for the external-content directory
   - Created index.md for the external-content directory
   - Updated the main FAQs toc.yml to include the external content section

4. Updated the state tracking file to reflect the completion of Phase 6

## Verification

All 38 use cases were successfully migrated and are now accessible through the DocFX navigation structure. The navigation hierarchy matches the GitBook structure, with use cases organized in a single directory.

## Next Steps

The next phase (Phase 7) will involve migrating all YouTube content from GitBook to DocFX, following a similar approach to what was done for use cases.

## Scripts Created

1. `create-directory-structure.ps1`: Creates the necessary directory structure for use cases
2. `run-phase6.ps1`: Migrates use cases content from GitBook to DocFX
3. `update-state.ps1`: Updates the state tracking file to reflect the completion of Phase 6

These scripts can be used as a reference for implementing future phases of the migration plan.
