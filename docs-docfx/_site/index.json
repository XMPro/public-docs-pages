    "summary": "XMPro Documentation Migration: GitBook to DocFX This document provides an overview of the migration process from GitBook to DocFX for the XMPro documentation. Migration Overview The XMPro documentation is being migrated from GitBook to DocFX. This migration involves: Setting up the DocFX project structure Migrating the navigation structure Migrating content pages Migrating images and other assets Implementing styling and customization Verifying links and functionality Deploying the migrated documentation Migration Plan The detailed migration plan is available in the migration-plan.md file. This plan outlines the step-by-step process for migrating the documentation, including: Branching strategy Migration steps Content migration guidelines Image migration Link updates Progress tracking Migration Helper Script A PowerShell script (migration-helper.ps1) has been created to assist with the migration process. This script helps automate the following tasks: Creating the directory structure Converting GitBook Markdown to DocFX Markdown Migrating images Generating TOC files Using the Migration Helper Script To use the migration helper script, follow these steps: Open a PowerShell terminal Navigate to the docs-docfx directory Run the script with the appropriate parameters .\\migration-helper.ps1 -GitBookPath \"C:\\path\\to\\gitbook\" -DocFXPath \"C:\\path\\to\\docfx\" Parameters -GitBookPath: The path to the GitBook repository -DocFXPath: The path to the DocFX repository -Section: (Optional) The section to migrate (e.g., \"getting-started\", \"concepts\") -CreateStructure: (Optional) Create the directory structure -MigrateContent: (Optional) Migrate content -MigrateImages: (Optional) Migrate images -GenerateToc: (Optional) Generate TOC files Examples Migrate everything: .\\migration-helper.ps1 -GitBookPath \"C:\\Work\\Git\\public-docs-pages\\docs-gitbook\" -DocFXPath \"C:\\Work\\Git\\public-docs-pages\\docs-docfx\" Migrate a specific section: .\\migration-helper.ps1 -GitBookPath \"C:\\Work\\Git\\public-docs-pages\\docs-gitbook\" -DocFXPath \"C:\\Work\\Git\\public-docs-pages\\docs-docfx\" -Section \"getting-started\" Create the directory structure only: .\\migration-helper.ps1 -GitBookPath \"C:\\Work\\Git\\public-docs-pages\\docs-gitbook\" -DocFXPath \"C:\\Work\\Git\\public-docs-pages\\docs-docfx\" -CreateStructure Migration Progress Tracking The migration progress is tracked in the following way: Each step in the migration plan is done on a separate feature branch Each branch is reviewed and merged through a pull request The progress is tracked in the migration plan document Branching Strategy The branching strategy for the migration is as follows: Create a feature branch for each step in the migration plan Implement the step on the feature branch Test the changes locally Create a pull request for review Merge the pull request to the main branch The branch naming convention is: migrate/[section-name]/[specific-task] For example: migrate/navigation/main-toc migrate/content/getting-started migrate/assets/images Creating Feature Branches For each step in the migration process, create a new feature branch from the main branch: # Create and switch to the feature branch git checkout main git pull git checkout -b migrate/[section-name]/[specific-task] Completing a Migration Step After completing a migration step: # Commit changes git add . git commit -m \"Description of changes\" git push -u origin migrate/[section-name]/[specific-task] # Create pull request (via GitHub UI) # After PR is approved and merged, proceed to the next step The migration plan includes specific git commands for each step to ensure consistency throughout the migration process. Testing the Migration To test the migration, follow these steps: Build the DocFX project: cd docs-docfx docfx build Serve the DocFX project locally: cd docs-docfx docfx serve _site Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 Verify that the documentation displays correctly Handling DocFX Build Warnings During the migration process, you will encounter various warnings when building the DocFX project. These warnings are normal and expected, especially during the early stages of migration when not all content has been migrated yet. For detailed information on how to handle these warnings, refer to the handling-docfx-warnings.md document. This document explains: Types of warnings you will encounter Why these warnings occur How to handle these warnings during the migration process Strategies for addressing specific warning types Using the migration helper script to resolve warnings Final cleanup process to address remaining warnings It's important to note that you can safely ignore most warnings during the migration process, as they will be resolved as you progress through the migration steps. However, it's good practice to keep track of warnings and address them incrementally as you migrate each section. Deployment A GitHub Actions workflow has been set up to automatically deploy the documentation to GitHub Pages whenever changes are merged into the main branch. This ensures that each migration step is immediately visible on the public documentation site once it's completed and merged. GitHub Actions Workflow The deployment workflow is defined in .github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml and performs the following steps: Checks out the repository Sets up .NET Installs DocFX Builds the DocFX documentation Deploys the built site to the gh-pages branch Deployment Process The deployment process is as follows: Complete a migration step on a feature branch Test the changes locally Create a pull request for the feature branch Review and merge the pull request into the main branch GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys the documentation to GitHub Pages Verify the changes on the live site Manual Deployment If needed, you can also trigger a manual deployment by: Going to the GitHub repository Clicking on the \"Actions\" tab Selecting the \"Deploy DocFX to GitHub Pages\" workflow Clicking on \"Run workflow\" Conclusion This migration process is designed to be iterative and incremental. Each step is completed and verified before moving on to the next step. This approach minimizes the risk of issues and ensures that the migration is done correctly. If you have any questions or issues with the migration process, please contact the documentation team."

    "title": "Data Stream | XMPro",
    "summary": "Data Stream A Data Stream is a visual representation of a flow of data. It is created through the Data Stream Designer and consists of Stream Objects that ingest, transform, analyze, and act on data. Overview Data Streams are the backbone of real-time data processing in XMPro. They allow you to: Ingest data from various sources Transform and enrich data Analyze data for patterns and anomalies Take actions based on the data Data Streams are designed to be: Visual and intuitive Real-time Scalable Flexible Components of a Data Stream A Data Stream consists of the following components: Stream Objects Stream Objects are the building blocks of a Data Stream. They are instances of Agents that perform specific functions in the data flow. Stream Objects are connected together to form a pipeline of data processing. Connections Connections define how data flows between Stream Objects. They are represented as arrows in the Data Stream Designer. Data Data flows through the Stream Objects and is transformed, analyzed, and acted upon as it moves through the Data Stream. Types of Data Streams There are two types of Data Streams: Streaming Streaming Data Streams run continuously, processing data as it arrives. They are used for real-time monitoring and alerting. Recurrent Recurrent Data Streams run on a schedule, processing data in batches. They are used for periodic reporting and analysis.

    "title": "Stream Object Configuration | XMPro",
    "summary": "Stream Object Configuration Stream Objects are the building blocks of a Data Stream. Each Stream Object is an instance of an Agent that performs a specific function in the data flow. This page explains how to configure Stream Objects in a Data Stream. Overview When you add a Stream Object to a Data Stream, you need to configure it to perform the specific function you want. The configuration options depend on the type of Agent the Stream Object is based on. Configuration Process To configure a Stream Object: Double-click on the Stream Object in the Data Stream Designer, or select the Stream Object and click the \"Configure\" button in the toolbar. The configuration panel for the Stream Object will open, showing the available configuration options. Configure the Stream Object according to your requirements. Click \"Apply\" to save the configuration. Common Configuration Options While each Agent type has its own specific configuration options, there are some common options that apply to most Stream Objects: Name The name of the Stream Object. This is displayed on the Stream Object in the Data Stream Designer. Description A description of the Stream Object. This is useful for documenting the purpose of the Stream Object. Input Mappings Input Mappings define how data from the previous Stream Object is mapped to the inputs of the current Stream Object. This is particularly important when the output schema of the previous Stream Object doesn't match the input schema expected by the current Stream Object. Error Handling Error Handling options define what happens when an error occurs in the Stream Object. Options typically include: Continue: Continue processing data even if an error occurs. Stop: Stop processing data if an error occurs. Retry: Retry the operation if an error occurs. Agent-Specific Configuration Each Agent type has its own specific configuration options. For example: Listener Agents Listener Agents ingest data from external sources. Configuration options typically include: Connection details: How to connect to the data source. Data format: The format of the data being ingested. Polling interval: How often to check for new data (for polling-based Listeners). Transformation Agents Transformation Agents transform data as it flows through the Data Stream. Configuration options typically include: Transformation logic: How to transform the data. Output schema: The schema of the transformed data. Action Agents Action Agents perform actions based on the data. Configuration options typically include: Action details: What action to perform. Trigger conditions: When to perform the action. Best Practices When configuring Stream Objects, consider the following best practices: Use meaningful names: Give your Stream Objects meaningful names that describe their purpose. Document your configuration: Use the description field to document the purpose and configuration of the Stream Object. Test your configuration: Use the Live View feature to test your configuration with sample data. Keep it simple: Break complex transformations into multiple simple transformations for better maintainability. Related Concepts Data Stream Verifying Stream Integrity Running Data Streams Timeline"

This step-by-step tutorial is meant to be an introduction to using the XMPro platform. Completing it will give you a solid foundation to understand the more advanced concepts and detailed how-to guides. This tutorial will explain how to create and design a Data Stream, configure Stream Objects to ingest, analyze, transform, and perform actions on data. You will also learn how to set up a Recommendation to generate alerts based on rule logic, create and design an App, create Data Sources and Connections, and configure a simple Data Grid and Chart. Warning Please note that the XMPro platform requires third-party cookies to be enabled on your browser. Use Case Let's assume there is a power plant that uses a heat exchanger to keep the turbine cool and at the optimum temperature. The heat exchanger circulates water between the cooling tower and the heat exchanger to dissipate heat. To keep a proper circulation of liquid, there are three pumps [A, B, C] installed. Each Pump has a sensor that provides live data for Flow Rate (L/m) and Temperature (°C) using MQTT. Unless the Pump is under maintenance the Flow Rate should be above 15000 L/m and Water temperature should be below 130°C. Engineers should be alerted if the average flow rate falls below 250 L/s. If the average temperature starts to rise above 130°C then a critical level alert should be raised. Engineers should be provided a view to check the history of pump telemetry, maintenance records, and reservoir level to enable them to take necessary action. 1. Design Data Streams with Real-Time Data Sources [Content for this section would be added during the actual migration] 2. Create Event Rules & Recommendations [Content for this section would be added during the actual migration] 3.

Types of Warnings The main types of warnings you will encounter are: Missing directories referenced in toc.yml files warning: Unable to find either toc.yml or toc.md inside xmpro-ai/. Make sure the file is included in config file docfx.json! Invalid file links in markdown files warning InvalidFileLink: Invalid file link:(~/docs/images/What_is_XMPro_Search_Light.png). Missing files referenced in toc.yml files Unable to find file \"collection.md\" for Href referenced by TOC file \"docs/concepts/toc.yml\" Why These Warnings Occur These warnings are normal during the migration process because: We're setting up the structure before all content is migrated We're creating placeholder files that reference other files that don't exist yet We're migrating the navigation structure before all content is available How to Handle These Warnings During the Migration Process During the migration process, you can safely ignore most of these warnings as they will be resolved as you progress through the migration steps. However, it's good practice to: Keep track of the warnings: Note which files and references are causing warnings so you can address them later Prioritize critical warnings: Focus on warnings that might affect the functionality of the site Address warnings incrementally: As you migrate each section, address the warnings related to that section Addressing Specific Warning Types Missing Directories For warnings about missing directories: Create the missing directory Create a placeholder toc.yml file in the directory Create a placeholder index.md file in the directory Example: mkdir docs-docfx/docs/xmpro-ai touch docs-docfx/docs/xmpro-ai/toc.yml touch docs-docfx/docs/xmpro-ai/index.md Invalid File Links For warnings about invalid file links: Create the missing images directory if it doesn't exist Copy the referenced images from the GitBook assets directory to the appropriate images directory Update the image references in the markdown files to use the correct paths Example: mkdir docs-docfx/docs/images Copy-Item docs-gitbook/docs/assets/What_is_XMPro_Search_Light.png -Destination docs-docfx/docs/images/ Missing Files Referenced in TOC For warnings about missing files referenced in toc.yml files: Create placeholder files for the missing files Update the toc.yml files to reference the correct paths Example: touch docs-docfx/docs/concepts/collection.md Using the Migration Helper Script The migration helper script (migration-helper.ps1) can help automate the process of addressing these warnings.

Completion: # Commit changes git add . git commit -m \"Final review and deployment preparation\" git push -u origin migrate/deployment/final # Create pull request (via GitHub UI) # After PR is approved and merged, the site will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages Continuous Deployment A GitHub Actions workflow has been set up to automatically deploy the documentation to GitHub Pages whenever changes are merged into the main branch. This ensures that each migration step is immediately visible on the public documentation site once it's completed and merged. The deployment workflow is defined in .github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml and performs the following steps: Checks out the repository Sets up .NET Installs DocFX Builds the DocFX documentation Deploys the built site to the gh-pages branch This means that after each migration step is completed and the feature branch is merged into main, the changes will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages. This allows for incremental deployment of the documentation as the migration progresses. Content Migration Guidelines Markdown Conversion GitBook and DocFX both use Markdown, but there are some differences in syntax and features. Here are some guidelines for converting GitBook Markdown to DocFX Markdown: Hints/Callouts: Convert GitBook hints to DocFX alerts: GitBook: > [!NOTE] > This is a note DocFX: > [!NOTE] > This is a note Tabs: Convert GitBook tabs to DocFX tabs: GitBook: {% tabs %} {% tab title=\"Tab 1\" %} Content for Tab 1 {% endtab %} {% tab title=\"Tab 2\" %} Content for Tab 2 {% endtab %} {% endtabs %} DocFX: # [Tab 1](#tab/tab1) Content for Tab 1 # [Tab 2](#tab/tab2) Content for Tab 2 *** Code Blocks: Ensure code blocks use the correct syntax: GitBook: ```javascript const x = 5; DocFX: ```markdown ```javascript const x = 5; Images: Update image paths to use the correct relative paths: GitBook: ![Alt text](../assets/image.png) DocFX: ![Alt text](../images/image.png) Links: Update links to use the correct relative paths: GitBook: [Link text](../path/to/page.md) DocFX: [Link text](../path/to/page.md) Image Migration Create an images directory in each section directory Copy images from the GitBook assets directory to the appropriate images directory Update image references in the Markdown files to use the new paths Link Updates Update internal links to use the correct relative paths Verify external links are correct Update anchor links to use the correct format Migration Helper Script A PowerShell script (migration-helper.ps1) will be created to assist with the migration process. This script will: Create the necessary directory structure Convert GitBook Markdown to DocFX Markdown Update image and link references Generate toc.yml files from the GitBook SUMMARY.md file Progress Tracking A progress tracking document will be maintained to keep track of the migration progress. This document will include: A list of all pages to be migrated The status of each page (Not Started, In Progress, Completed) Any issues or notes for each page Handling DocFX Build Warnings During the migration process, you will encounter various warnings when building the DocFX project. These warnings are normal and expected, especially during the early stages of migration when not all content has been migrated yet. Types of Warnings The main types of warnings you will encounter are: Missing directories referenced in toc.yml files Invalid file links in markdown files Missing files referenced in toc.yml files Handling Warnings A detailed guide on handling DocFX build warnings is available in the handling-docfx-warnings.md document. This document explains: Why these warnings occur How to handle these warnings during the migration process Strategies for addressing specific warning types Using the migration helper script to resolve warnings Final cleanup process to address remaining warnings Warning Resolution Strategy The strategy for handling warnings during the migration process is: Ignore non-critical warnings during initial migration: Focus on migrating content first, then address warnings Address warnings incrementally: As you migrate each section, address the warnings related to that section Create placeholder files and directories: For missing files and directories referenced in toc.yml files Migrate images early: To resolve invalid image references Perform final cleanup: Once all content is migrated, address any remaining warnings By following this strategy, you can effectively manage and resolve warnings without getting bogged down in fixing every warning during the initial migration process. Conclusion This migration plan provides a structured approach to migrating the XMPro documentation from GitBook to DocFX. By following this plan, the migration can be done in a systematic and controlled manner, ensuring that the migrated documentation is accurate, complete, and functional. Each step should be completed and verified before moving on to the next step. This approach minimizes the risk of issues and ensures that the migration is done correctly. Remember that warnings are a normal part of the migration process and should be addressed incrementally as you progress through the migration steps. Don't let warnings block your progress, but also don't ignore them completely."
