## Migration Overview

The migration will follow these high-level steps:

1. Set up the DocFX project structure
2. Migrate the navigation structure
3. Migrate core content pages
4. Migrate images and other assets
5. Implement styling and customization
6. Verify links and functionality
7. Deploy the migrated documentation

## Commit Strategy

Each step of the migration will be committed directly to the main branch of the public-docs-pages repository. This approach simplifies the workflow and ensures that changes are immediately available in the main branch.

**IMPORTANT:** Follow these steps for each migration task:

1. Make your changes
2. Add the changes to the staging area: `git add .`
3. Commit the changes: `git commit -m "Descriptive message about the changes"`
4. Push the changes to the remote repository: `git push origin main`

## Weekly Migration Status Meetings

To ensure the migration stays on track, weekly status meetings will be held every Monday at 10:00 AM. These meetings will:

1. Review progress from the previous week
2. Identify any blockers or issues
3. Assign tasks for the upcoming week
4. Update the migration plan and timeline as needed

Meeting notes will be recorded and shared with the team.

## Continuous Deployment

A GitHub Actions workflow has been set up to automatically deploy the documentation to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. This ensures that each migration step is immediately visible on the public documentation site once it's completed.

The deployment workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` and performs the following steps:

1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up .NET
3. Installs DocFX
4. Builds the DocFX documentation
5. Deploys the built site to the gh-pages branch

This means that after each migration step is completed and pushed to main, the changes will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages. This allows for incremental deployment of the documentation as the migration progresses.

## Content Migration Guidelines

### Markdown Conversion

GitBook and DocFX both use Markdown, but there are some differences in syntax and features. Here are some guidelines for converting GitBook Markdown to DocFX Markdown:

1. **Hints/Callouts:** Convert GitBook hints to DocFX alerts:

   GitBook:
   ```markdown
   > [!NOTE]
   > This is a note
   ```

   DocFX:
   ```markdown
   > [!NOTE]
   > This is a note
   ```

2. **Tabs:** Convert GitBook tabs to DocFX tabs:

   GitBook:
   ```markdown
   {% tabs %}
   {% tab title="Tab 1" %}
   Content for Tab 1
   {% endtab %}
   {% tab title="Tab 2" %}
   Content for Tab 2
   {% endtab %}
   {% endtabs %}
   ```

   DocFX:
   ```markdown
   # [Tab 1](#tab/tab1)
   Content for Tab 1

   # [Tab 2](#tab/tab2)
   Content for Tab 2

   ***
   ```

3. **Code Blocks:** Ensure code blocks use the correct syntax:

   GitBook:
   ```markdown
   ```javascript
   const x = 5;
   ```
   ```

   DocFX:
   ```markdown
   ```javascript
   const x = 5;
   ```
   ```

4. **Images:** Update image paths to use the correct relative paths:

   GitBook:
   ```markdown
   ![Alt text](../assets/image.png)
   ```

   DocFX:
   ```markdown
   ![Alt text](../images/image.png)
   ```

5. **Links:** Update links to use the correct relative paths:

   GitBook:
   ```markdown
   [Link text](../path/to/page.md)
   ```

   DocFX:
   ```markdown
   [Link text](../path/to/page.md)
   ```

### Image Migration

1. Create an `images` directory in each section directory
2. Copy images from the GitBook `assets` directory to the appropriate `images` directory
3. Update image references in the Markdown files to use the new paths

### Link Updates

1. Update internal links to use the correct relative paths
2. Verify external links are correct
3. Update anchor links to use the correct format

## Migration Helper Script

A PowerShell script (`migration-helper.ps1`) has been created to assist with the migration process. This script helps with:

1. Creating the necessary directory structure
2. Converting GitBook Markdown to DocFX Markdown
3. Updating image and link references
4. Generating toc.yml files from the GitBook SUMMARY.md file

To use the migration helper script, see the instructions in [MIGRATION-README.md](MIGRATION-README.md).

## Handling DocFX Build Warnings

During the migration process, you will encounter various warnings when building the DocFX project. These warnings are normal and expected, especially during the early stages of migration when not all content has been migrated yet.

### Types of Warnings

The main types of warnings you will encounter are:

1. Missing directories referenced in toc.yml files
2. Invalid file links in markdown files
3. Missing files referenced in toc.yml files

### Handling Warnings

A detailed guide on handling DocFX build warnings is available in the [handling-docfx-warnings.md](handling-docfx-warnings.md) document. This document explains:

- Why these warnings occur
- How to handle these warnings during the migration process
- Strategies for addressing specific warning types
- Using the migration helper script to resolve warnings
- Final cleanup process to address remaining warnings

### Warning Resolution Strategy

The strategy for handling warnings during the migration process is:

1. **Ignore non-critical warnings during initial migration**: Focus on migrating content first, then address warnings
2. **Address warnings incrementally**: As you migrate each section, address the warnings related to that section
3. **Create placeholder files and directories**: For missing files and directories referenced in toc.yml files
4. **Migrate images early**: To resolve invalid image references
5. **Perform final cleanup**: Once all content is migrated, address any remaining warnings

By following this strategy, you can effectively manage and resolve warnings without getting bogged down in fixing every warning during the initial migration process.

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a structured approach to migrating the XMPro documentation from GitBook to DocFX. By following this plan, the migration can be done in a systematic and controlled manner, ensuring that the migrated documentation is accurate, complete, and functional.

Each step should be completed and verified before moving on to the next step. This approach minimizes the risk of issues and ensures that the migration is done correctly.

Remember that warnings are a normal part of the migration process and should be addressed incrementally as you progress through the migration steps. Don't let warnings block your progress, but also don't ignore them completely.
