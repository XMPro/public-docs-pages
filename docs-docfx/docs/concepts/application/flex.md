# Flex

Flex (CSS Flexbox Layout Module) is a way to design flexible responsive layouts for web pages.

The main concept behind flex is the flex container. If you set a container to `display: flex;`, its child items' width or height will be expanded or shrunk to best fill the space available.

The direction the flex items will be stacked in is determined by the `flex-direction` property. The options include `row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, and `column-reverse`.

The alignment of the items in the main-axis (horizontal if `flex-direction` is `row` or `row-reverse`, vertical if `flex-direction` is `column` or `column-reverse`) is determined by the `justify-content` property. The options include `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `space-between`, `space-around`, and `center`.

![justify-content: center;](images/image (1364).png>)

The alignment of the items in the cross-axis (vertical if `flex-direction` is `row` or `row-reverse`, horizontal if `flex-direction` is `column` or `column-reverse`) is determined by the `align-items` property. The options include `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `stretch`, and `center`.

The child items of a flex container have a say in how they are altered. The `flex-grow` property on the child of a flex container defines whether the item should be the desired ratio of this item compared to its siblings.

The `flex-shrink` property defines how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items. Best used in conjunction with the flex-basis property.

The `flex-basis` property specifies the initial length of an item on the main-axis.
