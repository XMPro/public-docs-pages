# Form

A Form is a collection of fields that appear on [Recommendation Alerts](recommendation-alert.md). Forms are how relevant information can be entered and changed over the course of resolving an Alert. Forms can also contain buttons that allow specific actions to be performed in other business systems, like creating a work order in your EAM system. The Action Request Agent in the [Data Stream Designer](../data-stream/) will pass the data from your form to other systems.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
[See the Action Requests article for more details on Action Requests](action-requests.md).
{% endhint %}

When a [Recommendation Alert](recommendation-alert.md) is created from the [Rule](rule.md), the Rule's selected Form is used to determine the [fields (Blocks)](form.md#blocks) that will appear in the alert. Forms are managed through the Recommendations page.

The same form can be seen as created in a Recommendation Alert:

## Category

Forms can be organized into different categories. This refers to the category under which the Form is found in the Form list. This category is separate from the [App and Data Stream Categories](../category.md).

## Actions on the Form

The following Actions can be taken on a Recommendation Form:

<table><thead><tr><th width="199">Action</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="form.md#blocks">Blocks</a></td><td>Opens the list of Blocks that are available to the Form.</td></tr><tr><td>Properties</td><td>Opens the properties for the selected Block.</td></tr><tr><td>Save</td><td>Saves any changes made to the Form up to this point.</td></tr><tr><td>Discard</td><td>Discards any changes made to the Form up to this point.</td></tr><tr><td>Settings</td><td>Opens the Form Settings, where you can modify the Form's Name and Category or delete the Form.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../version.md">Manage Versions</a></td><td>Versioning for the Form.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../manage-access.md">Manage Access</a></td><td>Allows you to manage which users are allowed to view or modify this Recommendation and the Recommendation Alerts created by this Recommendation.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../how-tos/import-export-and-clone.md">Clone</a></td><td>Clones the Form as a new Form.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../how-tos/import-export-and-clone.md#exporting">Export</a></td><td>Export the Form as an encrypted file.</td></tr><tr><td>Delete</td><td>Deletes the Form.</td></tr></tbody></table>
