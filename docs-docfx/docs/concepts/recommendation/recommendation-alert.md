# Recommendation Alert

Recommendation Alerts are advanced alerts that are triggered when real-time data meets the criteria defined in a [Recommendation Rule](rule.md). They notify you when certain conditions occur in your data and provide decision support for how to take action.

The Recommendation Alerts are found by clicking on the Recommendations button in the menu on the left of the App Designer.

![Fig 1: Access the recommendations menu](/docs/images/image (682).png>)

The grid provides an overview of all the Alerts that you have access to. The rightmost Status column shows whether the Alert is Pending or Resolved.&#x20;

You can order, filter by specific values, search the alerts by any of the columns, and search in all columns in the Search bar.

To see Resolved as well as Pending Alerts, check the "Show Archived" checkbox.

Click on an Alert in the grid to navigate to the Recommendation Alert details.&#x20;
