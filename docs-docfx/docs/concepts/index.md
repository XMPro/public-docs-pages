# Concepts

This section provides detailed explanations of the core concepts in the XMPro platform. Understanding these concepts will help you build effective real-time applications.

## XMPro AI

[XMPro AI](xmpro-ai/index.md) provides AI capabilities to enhance your applications, including the XMPro Notebook for data analysis and machine learning.

## Data Stream

[Data Streams](data-stream/index.md) are the backbone of real-time data processing in XMPro. They allow you to ingest, transform, analyze, and act on data from various sources.

## Collection and Stream Host

[Collections and Stream Hosts](collection.md) manage the execution of Data Streams and provide scalability and reliability.

## Agent

[Agents](agent/index.md) are the building blocks of Data Streams, providing specific functionality for data ingestion, transformation, analysis, and actions.

## Application

[Applications](application/index.md) provide the user interface for your real-time solutions, allowing users to visualize data and take actions.

## Recommendation

[Recommendations](recommendation/index.md) enable you to create rules that trigger alerts and actions based on conditions in your data.

## Connector

[Connectors](connector.md) provide integration with external systems and data sources.

## Landing Pages & Favorites

[Landing Pages & Favorites](landing-pages.md) help users quickly access the information and applications they need.

## Version

[Versioning](version.md) allows you to manage changes to your Data Streams, Applications, and Recommendations over time.

## Manage Access

[Access Management](manage-access.md) controls who can view and edit your Data Streams, Applications, and Recommendations.

## Category

[Categories](category.md) help organize your Data Streams, Applications, and Recommendations.

## Variable

[Variables](variable.md) store configuration values that can be reused across your Data Streams, Applications, and Recommendations.

## Insights

[Insights](insights/index.md) provide analytics and monitoring capabilities for your Data Streams and Applications.
