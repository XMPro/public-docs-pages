# Landing Pages & Favorites

## Overview

A list of categories is displayed by default when you open App Designer or Data Stream Designer. In App Designer, this can be changed to display a custom landing page instead. When a custom landing page is set for a company, any user from that specific company will see that landing page when they first open App Designer. An App can be used as a landing page as long as it is published. This is useful if a company has a main App that they access and prevents them from continuously navigating to that App.

Apps and Data Streams can be favorited. This is useful for Apps or Data Streams that are frequently used, and favoriting them will allow them to appear on the main page of Subscription Manager for quick and easy access.

Blocks can also be favorited. This is useful for Blocks that are frequently used by a designer, and favoriting them will allow them to appear on the Favorites category of App Designer's Blocks for quick and easy access.

## Default Landing Page

When you load Data Stream Designer or App Designer, the default landing page lists the categories that contain Data Streams or Apps respectively.

Indicators at the bottom of each category card inform how many Data Streams/Apps are:

1. Published
2. Draft
3. Errors (published Data Streams with errors)

Click the category card to view all the contents, or on the counter for a filtered view.
