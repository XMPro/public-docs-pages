## Mobile BPM

Posted on [May 20, 2010](https://xmpro.com/mobile-bpm/) by [Pieter van Schalkwyk](https://xmpro.com/author/pietervs/)

Mobile BPM introduces a new set of design, use and security considerations and XMPro will publish some design guidelines in the course of the next few weeks to address how deploy Mobile BPM while taking the following into consideration:

\> Smaller screen sizes of mobile devices;\
\> Users that work discontinuously;\
\> Security of data in transit and at rest;\
\> The use of different platforms and “personally owned devices”;\
\> Limited bandwidth and complex transactional forms; and\
\> Synchronising users that switch between desktop and mobile devices.

XMPro’s XMMobile workspace provides business users access to processes that were previously only accessible from your desktop or notebook. See our News sections for announcements on our commitment to delivering mobile BPM to people that what to get better at getting work done.
