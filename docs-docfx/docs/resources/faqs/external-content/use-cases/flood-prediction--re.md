_Figure 1. Real-Time Flood Prediction and Response Dashboard for Water Utilities_

#### Real-Time Flood Prediction and Response Dashboard

This advanced dashboard provides water utility operators with a comprehensive, real-time view of their infrastructure, focusing on flood prediction and response. It features an interactive map that dynamically updates with live and predicted precipitation data, flood risk assessments from aggregated sources including meteorological data, Hydrological data, and Geographical Information System data. In addition to these data sources, the real time condition and the condition of various assets such as treatment plants, pump stations, reservoirs, and pipe networks may also indicate flooding.

**Color-Coded Asset Risk Indicators:**

Each water utility asset on the map is represented by colored circles indicating flood risk or operational problems: green for no problem, yellow for medium risk, and red for high risk requiring immediate action.

**Active Recommendations and Protocols:**

The dashboard highlights active recommendations generated by smart rule logic and AI, such as initiating flood prevention protocols, adjusting pump operation parameters, implementing staff safety protocols, intensifying water quality testing, and initiating controlled water releases from specific reservoirs.

**Asset-Specific Flood Risk and Health Metrics:**

Users can view flood risk factors and health metrics for each asset. For example, Treatment Plant TP007 might show no current flood risk, with all metrics within the healthy range and located outside the predicted flood zone.

**Weather Forecast and Warnings:**

The dashboard displays a 7-day weather forecast and live weather warnings, providing essential information for proactive planning and response.

**Maintenance and Operational Efficiency:**

A detailed graph tracks maintenance requirements across assets, prioritizing them based on upcoming service needs and flood risk assessments, ensuring efficient maintenance scheduling.

**Drill-Down Capability for Detailed Analysis:**

Each section of the dashboard allows for deeper exploration. Users can drill down into specific asset details, recommendation insights, and flood risk assessments, enabling targeted actions based on the system’s predictive analytics and recommendations.

This Real-Time Flood Prediction and Response Dashboard is designed to provide water utility operators with critical insights for effective flood management. It combines live weather data, predictive flood modeling, and asset health monitoring to ensure informed decision-making, optimal operational efficiency, and enhanced public safety in managing water utility infrastructure.
