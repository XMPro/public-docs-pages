# Sizing Guideline

This page provides guidance on sizing your XMPro deployment based on your requirements.

## Deployment Options

XMPro can be deployed in various configurations, including:

- **Cloud**: Deployed on Microsoft Azure or AWS.
- **On-Premises**: Deployed on your own infrastructure.
- **Hybrid**: A combination of cloud and on-premises deployment.

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

The following are the minimum hardware requirements for an XMPro deployment:

| Component | CPU | Memory | Disk Space |
|-----------|-----|--------|------------|
| XMPro Application Server | 4 cores | 8 GB | 100 GB |
| XMPro Database Server | 4 cores | 8 GB | 100 GB |
| XMPro Stream Host | 2 cores | 4 GB | 50 GB |

### Recommended Requirements

For optimal performance, the following hardware specifications are recommended:

| Component | CPU | Memory | Disk Space |
|-----------|-----|--------|------------|
| XMPro Application Server | 8 cores | 16 GB | 250 GB |
| XMPro Database Server | 8 cores | 16 GB | 250 GB |
| XMPro Stream Host | 4 cores | 8 GB | 100 GB |

## Scaling Considerations

### Vertical Scaling

Vertical scaling involves adding more resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to existing servers. This is suitable for small to medium-sized deployments.

### Horizontal Scaling

Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers to the deployment. This is suitable for large deployments with high availability requirements.

#### Application Server Scaling

The XMPro Application Server can be scaled horizontally by deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer.

#### Stream Host Scaling

The XMPro Stream Host can be scaled horizontally by deploying multiple instances and distributing data streams across them.

## Performance Considerations

### Database Performance

The performance of the XMPro Database Server is critical for the overall performance of the system. Consider the following:

- Use a dedicated database server for XMPro.
- Use a high-performance storage system (SSD or NVMe).
- Optimize database configuration for your workload.

### Network Performance

Network performance can impact the responsiveness of the system, especially for real-time applications. Consider the following:

- Use a high-bandwidth, low-latency network connection between XMPro components.
- Minimize network hops between XMPro components.
- Use a content delivery network (CDN) for static content.

### Stream Host Performance

The performance of the XMPro Stream Host is critical for real-time data processing. Consider the following:

- Deploy Stream Hosts close to data sources to minimize latency.
- Use a high-performance storage system for Stream Host logs.
- Monitor Stream Host performance and scale as needed.

## Sizing Examples

### Small Deployment

A small deployment suitable for up to 50 concurrent users:

- 1 XMPro Application Server (4 cores, 8 GB RAM)
- 1 XMPro Database Server (4 cores, 8 GB RAM)
- 1 XMPro Stream Host (2 cores, 4 GB RAM)

### Medium Deployment

A medium deployment suitable for up to 200 concurrent users:

- 2 XMPro Application Servers (8 cores, 16 GB RAM each) behind a load balancer
- 1 XMPro Database Server (8 cores, 16 GB RAM)
- 2 XMPro Stream Hosts (4 cores, 8 GB RAM each)

### Large Deployment

A large deployment suitable for up to 1000 concurrent users:

- 4 XMPro Application Servers (8 cores, 16 GB RAM each) behind a load balancer
- 1 XMPro Database Server (16 cores, 32 GB RAM)
- 4 XMPro Stream Hosts (4 cores, 8 GB RAM each)

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Regular monitoring and maintenance are essential for optimal performance. Consider the following:

- Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage on all servers.
- Monitor database performance and optimize as needed.
- Monitor Stream Host performance and scale as needed.
- Regularly back up the XMPro database and configuration.
- Keep XMPro components up to date with the latest patches and updates.
