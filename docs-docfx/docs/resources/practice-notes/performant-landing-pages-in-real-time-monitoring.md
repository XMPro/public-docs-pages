# Performant Landing Pages in Real-Time Monitoring

This practice note provides guidance on creating performant landing pages for real-time monitoring applications in XMPro.

## Overview

Landing pages in real-time monitoring applications serve as the primary interface for users to monitor and interact with real-time data. These pages need to be highly performant to ensure a responsive user experience, especially when dealing with large volumes of real-time data.

## Best Practices

### 1. Optimize Data Loading

Efficient data loading is critical for performant landing pages. Consider the following strategies:

#### Implement Progressive Loading

Load data progressively to improve the perceived performance of your landing pages:

- **Initial Load**: Load only the essential data needed for the initial view.
- **Deferred Loading**: Load additional data after the initial page load.
- **On-Demand Loading**: Load data only when requested by the user (e.g., when scrolling or clicking).

#### Use Data Pagination

Implement pagination for large datasets to reduce the amount of data loaded at once:

- **Server-Side Pagination**: Fetch only a subset of data from the server.
- **Client-Side Pagination**: Divide already loaded data into pages on the client side.
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Load data as the user scrolls, maintaining a fixed number of items in the DOM.

#### Implement Data Caching

Cache data to reduce the number of requests to the server:

- **Browser Cache**: Leverage browser caching for static resources.
- **Application Cache**: Implement application-level caching for frequently accessed data.
- **Session Cache**: Cache data for the duration of a user session.

### 2. Optimize Visualization Components

Visualization components can significantly impact the performance of landing pages. Consider the following strategies:

#### Choose Appropriate Visualization Types

Select visualization types that are appropriate for the data and use case:

- **Simple Visualizations**: Use simple visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts) for large datasets.
- **Complex Visualizations**: Reserve complex visualizations (e.g., network graphs, heat maps) for smaller datasets or detailed views.
- **Text-Based Representations**: Consider text-based representations (e.g., tables, lists) for data that doesn't require graphical representation.

#### Implement Lazy Rendering

Render visualizations only when they are visible to the user:

- **Viewport Detection**: Render visualizations only when they enter the viewport.
- **Tab-Based Rendering**: Render visualizations only when their containing tab is active.
- **Modal-Based Rendering**: Render detailed visualizations only when a modal is opened.

#### Optimize Chart Performance

Optimize chart performance to ensure smooth rendering and interaction:

- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregate data to reduce the number of data points.
- **Data Sampling**: Sample data to reduce the number of data points while maintaining the overall pattern.
- **Progressive Rendering**: Render charts progressively, starting with a low-resolution version and gradually increasing the detail.

### 3. Implement Efficient Layouts

Efficient layouts can significantly improve the performance and usability of landing pages. Consider the following strategies:

#### Use a Grid-Based Layout

Implement a grid-based layout for flexible and responsive designs:

- **Fixed Grid**: Use a fixed grid for consistent layouts across different screen sizes.
- **Fluid Grid**: Use a fluid grid for layouts that adapt to the available screen space.
- **Mixed Grid**: Use a combination of fixed and fluid grids for complex layouts.

#### Implement Responsive Design

Ensure your landing pages adapt to different screen sizes and devices:

- **Breakpoints**: Define breakpoints for different screen sizes.
- **Flexible Images**: Use flexible images that scale with the container.
- **Media Queries**: Use media queries to apply different styles based on screen size.

#### Minimize Layout Shifts

Minimize layout shifts to improve user experience:

- **Fixed Dimensions**: Use fixed dimensions for elements that will contain dynamic content.
- **Placeholders**: Use placeholders for content that will be loaded asynchronously.
- **Content-Aware Design**: Design layouts that accommodate varying content sizes.

### 4. Optimize Real-Time Updates

Efficient handling of real-time updates is essential for monitoring applications. Consider the following strategies:

#### Implement Throttling and Debouncing

Control the frequency of updates to prevent overwhelming the UI:

- **Throttling**: Limit the frequency of updates to a specified interval.
- **Debouncing**: Delay updates until a specified period of inactivity.
- **Batching**: Combine multiple updates into a single update.

#### Use Efficient Update Mechanisms

Choose efficient mechanisms for updating the UI:

- **Partial Updates**: Update only the parts of the UI that have changed.
- **Virtual DOM**: Use a virtual DOM to minimize actual DOM manipulations.
- **Web Workers**: Perform heavy computations in a separate thread.

#### Implement Update Prioritization

Prioritize updates based on their importance:

- **Critical Updates**: Apply critical updates immediately.
- **Important Updates**: Apply important updates with minimal delay.
- **Non-Critical Updates**: Apply non-critical updates during idle periods.

### 5. Implement Efficient State Management

Efficient state management is crucial for maintaining performance as the complexity of your application grows. Consider the following strategies:

#### Centralize State Management

Implement a centralized state management solution:

- **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain a single source of truth for your application state.
- **Predictable State Changes**: Ensure state changes are predictable and traceable.
- **State Normalization**: Normalize state to avoid duplication and inconsistencies.

#### Implement Selective Updates

Update only the parts of the UI that are affected by state changes:

- **Component-Level Updates**: Update only the components affected by state changes.
- **Memoization**: Memoize expensive computations to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Change Detection**: Implement efficient change detection mechanisms.

#### Optimize State Access

Optimize how components access the application state:

- **Selectors**: Use selectors to extract specific parts of the state.
- **Derived State**: Compute derived state on-demand rather than storing it.
- **Context Providers**: Use context providers to make state available to components that need it.

### 6. Implement Efficient Error Handling

Robust error handling is essential for maintaining the reliability of your application. Consider the following strategies:

#### Implement Graceful Degradation

Ensure your application continues to function even when errors occur:

- **Fallback Content**: Display fallback content when data cannot be loaded.
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations.
- **Error Boundaries**: Use error boundaries to prevent errors from crashing the entire application.

#### Provide Clear Error Messages

Help users understand and recover from errors:

- **User-Friendly Messages**: Provide clear, user-friendly error messages.
- **Recovery Instructions**: Include instructions on how to recover from errors.
- **Contact Information**: Provide contact information for support.

#### Log and Monitor Errors

Track errors to identify and address issues:

- **Client-Side Logging**: Log errors on the client side for debugging.
- **Server-Side Logging**: Log errors on the server side for monitoring.
- **Error Analytics**: Analyze error patterns to identify recurring issues.

### 7. Implement Efficient Navigation

Efficient navigation helps users quickly access the information they need. Consider the following strategies:

#### Implement a Clear Navigation Structure

Provide a clear and intuitive navigation structure:

- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Organize navigation items in a logical hierarchy.
- **Breadcrumbs**: Use breadcrumbs to show the current location in the navigation hierarchy.
- **Search**: Provide a search function for quickly finding specific information.

#### Optimize Navigation Performance

Ensure navigation actions are responsive:

- **Preloading**: Preload content for likely navigation targets.
- **Caching**: Cache previously visited pages.
- **Lazy Loading**: Load navigation components only when needed.

#### Provide Context-Aware Navigation

Adapt navigation based on the user's context:

- **Role-Based Navigation**: Show navigation items relevant to the user's role.
- **Context-Sensitive Menus**: Show context-sensitive menu items based on the current view.
- **Recently Visited**: Provide quick access to recently visited pages.

## Implementation Example

### Performant Dashboard Layout

The following example shows how to implement a performant dashboard layout using XMPro blocks:

1. Create a new page in your application called "Monitoring Dashboard".
2. Add a Layout Grid block to create a responsive grid layout.
3. Add Card blocks to the grid to contain different visualizations.
4. Configure each Card to load its content progressively:
   - Set the initial loading state to show a placeholder.
   - Load the actual content after the initial page load.
   - Implement lazy loading for visualizations that are not initially visible.

### Real-Time Data Visualization

The following example shows how to implement efficient real-time data visualization:

1. Create a Data Stream that provides real-time data.
2. Configure the Data Stream to aggregate data to reduce the volume.
3. Implement throttling to limit the frequency of updates:
   ```javascript
   // Throttle updates to once per second
   function throttle(callback, limit) {
     var waiting = false;
     return function() {
       if (!waiting) {
         callback.apply(this, arguments);
         waiting = true;
         setTimeout(function() {
           waiting = false;
         }, limit);
       }
     };
   }
   
   // Apply throttling to the update function
   var throttledUpdate = throttle(updateChart, 1000);
   
   // Use the throttled function for updates
   dataStream.onData(throttledUpdate);
   ```

4. Implement partial updates to minimize DOM manipulations:
   ```javascript
   function updateChart(newData) {
     // Update only the data points that have changed
     chart.data.datasets.forEach((dataset, i) => {
       dataset.data.forEach((value, j) => {
         if (value !== newData[i][j]) {
           dataset.data[j] = newData[i][j];
         }
       });
     });
     
     // Update the chart without a full redraw
     chart.update('none');
   }
   ```

### Efficient State Management

The following example shows how to implement efficient state management:

1. Define a centralized state store:
   ```javascript
   const store = {
     state: {
       data: [],
       filters: {},
       selectedItems: []
     },
     
     // Update state and notify subscribers
     setState(newState) {
       this.state = { ...this.state, ...newState };
       this.notifySubscribers();
     },
     
     // Subscribe to state changes
     subscribe(callback) {
       this.subscribers.push(callback);
       return () => {
         this.subscribers = this.subscribers.filter(cb => cb !== callback);
       };
     },
     
     // Notify subscribers of state changes
     notifySubscribers() {
       this.subscribers.forEach(callback => callback(this.state));
     },
     
     subscribers: []
   };
   ```

2. Implement selectors to efficiently access state:
   ```javascript
   // Selector for filtered data
   function getFilteredData(state) {
     return state.data.filter(item => {
       // Apply filters
       for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(state.filters)) {
         if (item[key] !== value) {
           return false;
         }
       }
       return true;
     });
   }
   
   // Use the selector to get filtered data
   const filteredData = getFilteredData(store.state);
   ```

3. Implement memoization to avoid redundant calculations:
   ```javascript
   // Memoize the getFilteredData function
   const memoizedGetFilteredData = (function() {
     let cachedState = null;
     let cachedResult = null;
     
     return function(state) {
       if (cachedState === state) {
         return cachedResult;
       }
       
       cachedState = state;
       cachedResult = getFilteredData(state);
       return cachedResult;
     };
   })();
   
   // Use the memoized function
   const filteredData = memoizedGetFilteredData(store.state);
   ```
