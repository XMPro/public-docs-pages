# Companies

Companies are the top-level organizational units in XMPro. Each company represents a separate organization that uses the XMPro platform.

As an administrator, you can:

- [Register a new company](register-a-company.md)
- [Manage existing companies](manage-a-company.md)
- [Manage company subscriptions](manage-company-subscriptions.md)
- [Manage licenses](manage-license.md)

Companies have their own users, subscriptions, and settings. Users from one company cannot access resources from another company unless explicitly granted access.
