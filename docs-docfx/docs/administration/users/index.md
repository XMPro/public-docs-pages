# Users

Users are individuals who have access to the XMPro platform. Each user belongs to a company and has specific roles and permissions within that company.

As an administrator, you can:

- [Invite new users](invite-a-user.md)
- [Register user accounts](register-an-account.md)
- [Manage user profiles](profile.md)
- [Change user passwords](change-password.md)
- [Reset user passwords](reset-password.md)
- [Delete users](delete-a-user.md)
- [Change user business roles](business-role-for-a-user.md)

User management is an important aspect of maintaining security and ensuring that users have the appropriate access to features and services within the XMPro platform.
