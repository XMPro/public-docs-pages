# Change Business Role

This page explains how to change the business role for a user in the XMPro platform.

## Prerequisites

Common business roles include:

- Executive
- Manager
- Supervisor
- Operator
- Technician
- Engineer
- Analyst
- Developer
- Administrator
- Custom roles defined by your organization

## Accessing User Management
