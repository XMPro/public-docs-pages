# Language

## Overview

XMPro follows the common industry approach for how major no-code/low-code platforms handle translations for technical terms, i.e.:

1. _Keep in English:_

* _SQL-related terms_
* _Programming concepts_
* _Industry-standard acronyms_
* _Technical protocols_

2. _Translate:_

* _UI navigation elements_
* _Error messages_
* _Help documentation_
* _Descriptive text_

_Certain things are in the primary company language: product roles & email templates._
