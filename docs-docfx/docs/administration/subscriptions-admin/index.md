# Subscriptions

Subscriptions in XMPro control access to features and services. They determine what products and features users can access within the platform.

As an administrator, you can:

- [Manage user access to subscriptions](manage-user-access.md)
- [Set up auto-approval and default subscriptions](setup-auto-approvals-default-subscriptions.md)
- [Request and apply licenses](request-and-apply-a-license.md)

Subscriptions are assigned to users within a company. Different users may have different subscription levels based on their roles and responsibilities.
