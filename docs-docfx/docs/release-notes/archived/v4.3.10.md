# v4.3.10

## App Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | [Search functionality](../../../docs/blocks-toolbox/basic/tree-grid.md#common-properties-1) was added to the Tree Grid Block. |
| Fix | When using a variable as a data source [parameter](../../../docs/concepts/application/data-integration.md#parameters), updates to that variable are not applied when refreshing the data source (introduced in v4.3.5).<br>*Variables as data source parameters are updated as expected.* |
| Fix | Bold and Italic styling is not applied to Recommendation Alert [Triage Instructions](../../../docs/concepts/recommendation/recommendation-alert.md#triage-instructions).<br>*The Bold and Italic styling is correctly applied.* |

## Data Stream Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | Users able to [delete agent versions](../../../docs/how-tos/agents/manage-agents.md#deleting-agent-versions) see the total usage count.<br><br>Previously, admins saw the total agent version usage, and everyone else saw the usage in data streams to which they had access. Now users with DeleteAgent [rights](../../../docs/administration/subscriptions-admin/manage-user-access.md#data-stream-designer-rights-and-roles) can also see the total usage - empowering them to see which agent versions can be deleted. |
| Fix | The Collection view's '[Started On](../../../docs/how-tos/data-streams/use-stream-metrics.md#started-on)' Stream Metrics are correct when the page loads, but do not refresh if a Stream Host later goes online or offline. <br>*The 'Started On' Stream Metrics are updated in real-time.* |
