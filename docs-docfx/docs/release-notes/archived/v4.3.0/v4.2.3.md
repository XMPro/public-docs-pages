It is also possible to add third-party endpoints to monitor all of your health checks in a central location. |
| Enhancement | The installation process of the XMPro application on [Azure infrastructure](../../../../installation/deployment/azure.md#install) has been improved: the application version number is now appended to the "mainTemplate.json" filename. For instance, the filename would be "mainTemplate_4.2.3.json" for version 4.2.3 of the application. |
