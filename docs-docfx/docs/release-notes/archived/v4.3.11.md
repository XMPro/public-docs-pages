# v4.3.11

## Common

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | Provide a visual representation of the XMPro product suite (each app service excluding Subscription Manager) to facilitate quicker analysis and the diagnosis of issues. <br><br>The ARM deployment template includes a Log Analytics workspace, Application Insights, and an Availability Test (using the AD and DS health check endpoints). |

## App Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | As highlighted in [v4.3.8](v4.3.8.md#app-designer), we can do better for data privacy by adding more stringent authorization controls to authenticated endpoints. In this release, access and product rights were added to *low-priority* recommendation, variable, and application endpoints. |
| Fix | The [Unity Block](../../../docs/blocks-toolbox/visualizations/unity.md) does not show a data stream's real-time values updated on the model when using a connector with live updates.<br>*Live data is supported on the Unity block.* |
| Fix | Non-admin user is unable to save, resolve, or send discussion messages on alerts to which they have run access (Error message: Sorry, something went wrong. Unable to send message.)<br>*Users with the View Recommendation Alert product access right and Run Access for an alert can interact with it.* |
| Fix | Although [Log Data On](../../../docs/concepts/recommendation/rule.md#log-data-on) was set to 'All Occurrences', the [Event Data](../../../docs/concepts/recommendation/recommendation-alert.md#event-data) was not updated if the Rule's [Recurrence](../../../docs/concepts/recommendation/rule.md#recurrence) was 'First Occurrence'.<br>*With the same configuration, one alert is generated but the event data is updated with every occurrence that the rule logic is met.* |
| Fix | Users able to [delete connector versions](../../../docs/how-tos/connectors/manage-connectors.md#versions-of-a-connector) see the total usage count.<br><br>Previously, admins saw the total connector version usage, and everyone else saw the usage in apps to which they had access. Now users with DeleteConnector [rights](../../../docs/administration/subscriptions-admin/manage-user-access.md#data-stream-designer-rights-and-roles) can also see the total usage - empowering them to see which connector versions can be deleted. |
| Fix | The [Connector Usage Details](../../../docs/how-tos/manage-site-settings.md#connector-usage-details-report) report does not match the Connector Usage report when an Application has multiple versions.<br>*Application Version was added to the Connector Usage Details report and the total matches the summary report.* |

## XMPro Notebook

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | Added OpenCV Python to the default XMPro Notebook [libraries](../../../docs/concepts/xmpro-ai/xmpro-notebook.md#libraries). |
