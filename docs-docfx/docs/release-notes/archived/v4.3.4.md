## Stream Hosts

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|

## App Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | Block styling to achieve rounded corners (using Border Radius properties) is ignored at runtime to ensure the child elements are visible.<br>*The Overflow property was added to **all** Visual and Recommendation Blocks. Designers can determine whether block styling covers the corners of child elements (hidden) or not (visible).* |
| Fix | The Indicator Block color can be set using a static value, but using a quick expression has no effect at runtime. As a workaround, set a variable using the expression and bind the variable to the Color property.<br>*The Indicator Block color can be set using a static value or a quick expression.* |
| Fix | Although users can view all the alerts displayed by a Recommendation Block, they can only drill down into the details of alerts to which they have run access.<br>*The Recommendation Block displays the alerts to which the user has run access.* |

## Data Stream Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | The Notes text area of an Agent on the canvas is not editable until selecting a font option, such as bold or underline.<br>*You can start typing in the Notes text area when you select it.* |

## Subscription Manager

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | Product Right's blade is stuck loading for guest tenant users. <br>*The error has been resolved for guest tenant users and anyone with an extra-long username.* |
| Fix | ARM template's subscription blade is stuck loading for Global Admin (not Company Admin). <br>*Subscriptions load for all admin users so the existing licenses can be applied during the installation.* |
