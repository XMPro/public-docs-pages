# v4.3.8

## App Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | Although our endpoints are authenticated, we can do better for data privacy by adding more stringent authorization controls. These will be rolled out over the subsequent few releases.<br>In this release, access and product rights were added to *high-priority* recommendation endpoints. |

## Data Stream Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | The list of Stream Hosts for a Collection is sorted alphabetically. |
| Fix | Republishing a recurring Data Stream where the [Start Repeat On](../../../how-tos/data-streams/manage-recurrent-data-streams.md#configuring-recurrence-for-agents) date is now in the past does not work as expected.<br>*When the Start Repeat On date is in the past, treat the recurrence as if Start Repeat was set to Immediately.* |
| Fix | The [Calculated Field Agent](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/calculated-field/)'s 'Expression Text Area' is not maximized when the blade is maximized.<br>*For all Agents that utilize a Script Box in their configuration, the editable area is expanded when the configuration blade is maximized.* |
| Fix | The Data Stream's Help toolbar button resulted in a 'page not found' error.<br>The Help toolbar button points [here](../../../resources/integrations.md). |
