# v4.3.7

## Common

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Feature | A new [reports](../../../docs/how-tos/manage-site-settings.md#reports) section under site settings empowers administrators to examine aspects of Connector and Agent usage. |
| Enhancement | As promised, the [Application Insights with Telemetry](../../../docs/installation/complete-installation/configure-logging-optional.md#application-insights-plus-telemetry) logging option introduced last release for Stream Hosts is now available for all products except Subscription Manager. |

## App Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | No line is rendered on the [Time Series Chart](../../../docs/blocks-toolbox/visualizations/time-series-analysis.md) when an attribute returns a zero value.<br>*Every value appears on a Time Series Chart, including zero.* |

## Data Stream Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | The Polling Agent's default interval increased from 10 seconds to a sensor-appropriate value of one hour (3600 seconds). <br><br>Administrators can set this value using the new site setting [Default Polling Interval (seconds)](../../../docs/how-tos/manage-site-settings.md#default-polling-interval-seconds). |
| Fix | The Live View issue is addressed in the v4.3.7 release:<br>1. Open connections are closed regardless of how the Live View is closed (e.g. navigating away or closing the tab). <br>2. All connections are closed when the Data Stream Designer app service is restarted. <br><br>If you've upgraded to v4.3.7, use the [Reset Live View](../../../docs/how-tos/manage-site-settings.md#live-view-usage) button once to ensure all connections are closed (added in [v4.3.6](v4.3.6.md)). |

## Stream Hosts

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | [Azure SQL](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/azure-sql/) and [SQL Server](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/sql-server/) Agents were unable to run on an Ubuntu Stream Host.<br>*This error has been resolved. Refer to the Agent documentation for information on the Stream Host version pre-requisite.* |
