## App Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|

| Fix | *I created a new Recommendation, but when I opened the Version blade I noticed the title was blank.*<br>The title of a new Recommendation default to "Initial Version". |
| Fix | *I am the owner of a Recommendation, but I cannot view it's timeline - yet my colleague with Run Access can.*<br>Users with design access are able to view a Recommendation's timeline. |

## Stream Host

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | *I accidentally used the incorrect password on an MQTT agent and published the data stream. The stream did not start due to the connection error on the agent, but I noticed the agent continues attempting to connect to the MQTT broker.*<br>The Stream Host ensures that if a data stream fails to start or is unpublished, all of that stream's agents (whose *Create()* methods have already run) are [destroyed](../how-tos/agents/building-agents.md#destroy). |
