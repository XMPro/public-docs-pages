| Enhancement | When using the [TSC SQL Connector](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MZASoMaVZCmWsNG58Xo/s/BAJZpMV4srQJyRnAmEml/), the [Time Series Chart](../blocks-toolbox/visualizations/time-series-analysis.md#connector-selection)'s performance is enhanced with optimized client-side querying (v4.3.2). <br>The new [ITSCConnector](../how-tos/connectors/building-connectors.md#itscconnector) interface instructs the Time Series Chart to use optimized client-side querying. Use it when building new TSC Connectors that pre-process large volumes of data and return it in buckets. |

The new, improved Stream Host core is now the default in all new installations, in line with the recommendation made in [v4.4.0](v4.4.0.md). <br><br>Please reach out should you want to revert to the old core as we'd like to understand why and guide you through the process. |
