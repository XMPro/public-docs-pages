## App Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | We've added the Application name as a hover tooltip to the Application listing so that you don't have to expand the blade to see the longer names. |
| Fix | *I selected 'None' in the new* [*Alert Discussion*](../blocks-toolbox/recommendations/recommendation-alert-discussion.md#type) *Block, but it reverts to 'Entity'.*<br>You can select 'None' as the type in the Alert Discussion Block, so that there is no header grid. |
| Fix | *I've ticked to Group By Asset in a Time Series Analysis Block, but I can't choose an Asset Id Expression because the dropdown is empty.*<br>The Asset Id Expression dropdown is populated, but there will be a follow up fix in a future release because when a value is later selected for the secondary data source, the dropdown value will appear empty. This is a UX issue only - your value is still present and the block will work as expected. |
| Fix | *My* [*Free Trial*](../getting-started/free-trial.md)*'s demo App, Renewable Condition Monitoring, is not displaying any alerts, but if I navigate to the recommendations menu I can see alerts have been generated.*<br>New Free Trials are correct. Prior to v4.4.10, please correct the configuration:<ol><li>Edit the demo app, Renewable Condition Monitoring</li><li>Select the Alert List Block (previously known as Recommendations)</li><li>Click Block Properties and expand the Behavior accordion</li><li>Tick the Oil Recommendation</li><li>Save your change</li></ol> |

## Data Stream Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | *In v4.4.9, I opened a data stream with multiple versions and noticed the first version opened and not the latest.*<br>Opening a data stream shows the latest (highest number) version. This and related functionality have also been optimized for a faster experience. |
