## Common

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | *I ran the on-prem installers for App Designer and Data Stream Designer using the Installation Profile, but an "invalid_grant" error is thrown.*<br>This error, introduced with v4.4.7's package upgrades, has been resolved. |

## App Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | [Favorite](../how-tos/manage-landing-pages.md#favorite-a-block) your commonly used Blocks to access them more easily from a new Block category, Favorites. |
| Enhancement | The Metablock supports [Value Mappings](../blocks-toolbox/advanced/metablock.md#value-mapping) so that static, data source of expression values can be passed into the Metablock on page load. |
| Fix | *I tried splitting my script into 3 and using the new Metablock, but my App is throwing 500 errors for the styling and script files. The single script file works as expected.*<br>The Metablock handles CSS and JavaScript injection at runtime, so explicit import code isn't needed and will result in the 500 error. See [here](../blocks-toolbox/advanced/metablock.md#why-is-the-metablock-throwing-500-errors-related-to-styling-and-script-files) for more. |
| Fix | *I created a new expression on my new App. I did something else and when I returned to Page Data, the expression was missing. I tried to add it again, but observed an error that the name was in use.*<br>The display has been corrected so that newly created expressions remain on the list of data source columns until deleted. |
| Fix | *I opened Manage Access on my App to grant Design Access to one user, but clicking one user selects them all.*<br>Clicking an individual user only selects that user and no others. |
| Fix | *I clicked Edit Templates after adding a new notification to a Recommendation Rule, but clicking one template selects them all.*<br>Clicking an individual template only selects that one and no others. |

## Data Stream Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | *I cannot upload a* [*bulk agent*](../how-tos/agents/manage-agents.md#bulk-adding-agents) *file even though it meets the requirements - the compressed size is 29MB and the pre-compression contents are 90MB.*<br>The internal API limit was increased to the bulk Agent file limit of 100MB. |
