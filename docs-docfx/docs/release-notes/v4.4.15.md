# v4.4.15

## Integrations

| Change Type | Name | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| Fix | [Erbessd Listener v3.40](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/erbessd) | Fixed an [output payload](../how-tos/agents/building-agents.md#output-payload) error when transpose data to columns is ticked without specifying an axis. |
| Fix | [Event Simulator v1.41](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/event-simulator) | Added error handling to prevent crashing the Stream Host if any other Agent in the same Data Stream fails to start while publishing the Data Stream. |

## App Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | *The* [*Metablock*](../blocks-toolbox/advanced/metablock.md) *usually works as expected, but in one of my App Pages it loads without the CSS styling.*<br>The CSS styling is now applied after the iframe is loaded to ensure the page loads correctly - even under slow loading conditions. |
