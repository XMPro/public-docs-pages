# v4.4.6

## Integrations

| Change Type | Name | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| Enhancement | [Erbessd Listener v3.10](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/erbessd/) | Support getting only new values from the second poll onwards.<br>Support an asset not having the point sensor installed. |
| Enhancement | [Neo4J Connector v1.01](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/neo4j-connector/) | Repackaged to align property names to the Neo4J Agents. |
| Enhancement | [MLflow AI & ML v1.07](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/mlflow/) | Repackaged as non-virtual as the Stream Host is required to access the MLflow server. |

## App Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Feature | New Blocks added:<ul><li>[Metablock](../blocks-toolbox/advanced/metablock.md) - add your tech to XMPro.</li><li>[Recommendation Alert Form](../blocks-toolbox/recommendations/alert-form.md) - reuse [this](../concepts/recommendation/recommendation-alert.md#form) form section to add a collection of fields on individual Recommendation Alerts.</li></ul> |
| Enhancement | The [site settings](../how-tos/manage-site-settings.md#app-designer-settings) were tidied up: <ul><li>The UI category was renamed to [User Interface](../how-tos/manage-site-settings.md#user-interface)</li><li>The Hide Mobile App property (added v4.4.5) was renamed [Enable Mobile App](../how-tos/manage-site-settings.md#enable-mobile-app)</li><li>The Company Landing Page category was incorporated into the User Interface category.</li></ul> |
| Fix | *When I add a stored procedure as a data source, its parameters appear in the data source column list.*<br>Stored procedure parameters are excluded from appearing in the data source column list. |
| Fix | *When I have the data source of two different apps open, each in their own browser tab, and I update one data source, I note that the primary key of the other data source is cleared too.*<br>Updating the data source of one App does not affect another App's data source. |
| Fix | *When I* [*remove multiple connections*](../how-tos/apps/manage-connections.md#multiple-connections)*, any connections below them in the list are hidden until I refresh the page.*<br>Only selected connections are removed and unselected connections remain on the list. |
| Fix | *No Alerts are triggered for my Recommendation, but I can't see any error in the Stream Host log.*<br>Null values are handled by the Recommendation engine and errors are logged in the Stream Host logs. |
| Fix | The bottom border and shading was added to the profile menu. |
| Fix | *I've noticed a performance issue when using a Select Box in my App as it results in multiple read calls on the page load.*<br>All Blocks were reviewed to ensure no more read calls were made than necessary. Most only require one read. The [Select Box](../blocks-toolbox/basic/select-box.md) has been optimized, but is still requires at least two: one to read the selected row and another for the rest of the data. We have opened a support ticket with the third party regarding the [Lookup Block](../blocks-toolbox/basic/lookup.md), as it still sends multiple calls for an unknown reason. |

## Data Stream Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | We've added the Data Stream name as a hover tooltip to the Data Stream listing so that you don't have to expand the blade to see the longer names. |

## Subscription Manager

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | *As a global admin, when I switch between product roles, the product rights of the previous roles are displayed.*<br>The correct product rights are displayed when switching between roles. |
