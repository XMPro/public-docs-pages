## Common

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | Lightweight [logging to file](../installation/complete-installation/configure-logging-optional.md#other-xmpro-products) is enabled by default for XMPro AI, App Designer, and Data Stream Designer - to avoid an early situation where troubleshooting is required but logging has not yet been configured. We recommend that administrators adjust the logging configuration to best suit their requirements. |
| Enhancement | [Application Insights](../installation/complete-installation/configure-logging-optional.md#application-insights) logging is turned on by default with the [Azure ARM template](../installation/deployment/azure.md#install). |
| Enhancement | We've extended our [User Access](../administration/subscriptions-admin/manage-user-access.md#data-stream-designer-rights) documentation to also include the rights included in each of the default product roles. |

## App Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | Should you not wish to make use of the XMPro mobile app, use the new [Hide Mobile App](../how-tos/manage-site-settings.md#hide-mobile-app) site setting to remove the mobile icon from the top toolbar. |
| Enhancement | Recommendation Alerts can be [assigned](../concepts/recommendation/recommendation-alert.md#assign-and-reassign) - and reassigned - to anyone with appropriate access. <br>We've also added the recommendation and rule name to the recommendation detail page for ease of reference. |
| Enhancement | The edit pencil, visible to designers on an App at runtime, has been moved so that it is not accidentally clicked while using the application. <br>Likewise, the user profile menu is activated by mouse click rather than on hover. |

## Data Stream Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | Users can choose the version when [upgrading](../how-tos/data-streams/upgrade-a-stream-object-version.md) an Agent in a Data Stream.<br>This de-risks the upgrade process where previously the latest version was the only option with no rollback. |

## Subscription Manager

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | It can be challenging to [manage access](../concepts/manage-access.md#business-roles-company-administrator) by dragging a user to a different business role if you have many users and business roles.<br>You can now [change a user's business role](../administration/users/business-role-for-a-user.md) from the user blade. |
