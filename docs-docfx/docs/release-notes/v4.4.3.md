## App Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | *The value I updated on the* [*Recommendation Form*](../concepts/recommendation/form.md) *(e.g. work request number) is no longer reflected in the* [*Recommendation Alert*](../concepts/recommendation/recommendation-alert.md) *grid's Additional Information column.*<br>The Recommendation Alert grid's Additional Information column displays data as expected. |
| Fix | *I now get an error 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length') when inserting new records using the Data Grid's Batch With External Save* [*edit mode*](../blocks-toolbox/basic/data-grid.md#edit-mode)*.*<br>The Data Grid's Batch With External Save functions as expected. |
| Fix | *I am no longer able to save a* [*resource*](../concepts/recommendation/rule.md#resources) *on a Recommendation Rule.*<br>Resources can be added to or removed from a Recommendation Rule as expected. |

## Data Stream Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | *My older Agent, Tungsten, is missing from the* [*Agent Polling Interval Report*](../how-tos/manage-site-settings.md#agent-polling-interval-report)*.*<br>*A few Data Streams in the* [*Agent Usage Details Report*](../how-tos/manage-site-settings.md#agent-usage-details-report) *have blank names and an owner "Unknown User".* <br>The standard reports work as expected for Agents that predate the [IPolling](../how-tos/agents/building-agents.md#ipolling-agent) Interface. |
| Fix | *I want to see the* [*Event Simulator Agent*](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/event-simulator) *on the* [*Agent Polling Interval Report*](../how-tos/manage-site-settings.md#agent-polling-interval-report)*. Even though it is not a Listener or Context Provider, the frequency of the events generated has an impact on performance.*<br>The Event Simulator Agent is included in the Agent Polling Interval Report. |
| Fix | *I am assigned the default 'User 'Role, but I can edit an Agent's category.*<br>[EditAgent](../administration/subscriptions-admin/manage-user-access.md#data-stream-designer-rights-and-roles) right was removed from the default User role. |

## Subscription Manager

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | *I've signed out of SM with my Single Sign-On (*[*SSO*](../installation/complete-installation/configure-sso-optional/)*), but if I'm quick I can open AD using a bookmark and continue using it - and vice versa.*<br>Signing out from one product takes effect instantly on all the products. |

## Stream Host

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | We've added a second Docker [image flavor](../installation/complete-installation/install-stream-host/docker.md#image-flavors), Alpine, which is a lightweight option, capable of running most Agents. The image flavor released in v4.4.2 is suitable when using the Python Agent. |
| Enhancement | We've also added documentation on how to [create a custom image](../installation/complete-installation/install-stream-host/docker.md#creating-a-custom-image) using pip, useful if you need a Stream Host with different capabilities. |
