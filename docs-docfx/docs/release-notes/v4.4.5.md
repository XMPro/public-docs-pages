# v4.4.5

## Integrations

| Change Type | Name | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| Enhancement | [Azure OpenAI AI & ML v1.04](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/azure-openai/) | Support dynamic messages and token counting |
| Enhancement | [Ollama AI & ML v1.04](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/ollama/) | Support single quotes in the input text. |

## Common

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | All logged-out state pages, such as the sign-in, will show in dark mode if a device's dark mode is activated. |
| Enhancement | The user profile menu is activated by mouse click rather than on hover - to avoid accidentally triggering it when interacting with items at the top right of the page. <br>This was introduced to App Designer in [v4.4.4](#app-designer) and now applies to all products. |
| Enhancement | The [health checks](../installation/complete-installation/configure-health-checks-optional.md) were extended to include XMPro AI. |

## App Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | A new advanced styling option, [Cursor](../concepts/application/block-styling.md#extra-advanced-styling), has been added to Block Styling. This allows you to choose the pointer icon for a block, such as to show that a Hyperlink Box is clickable. |
| Enhancement | The Navigate To Action's option to [Open in New Tab/Window](../blocks-toolbox/common-properties.md#open-in-new-tab-window) is now available for a Page too. |
| Enhancement | The default App Designer product role was amended from 'DesignUser' to 'Design User' for new installations for greater legibility and accessibility.<br>For existing installations, the global administrator is encouraged to amend the spelling. |
| Fix | *I cannot update a page parameter when a user clicks a Hyperlink.*<br>The Indicator, Templated List, and Hyperlink Box can pass a parameter to another page using an expression |
| Fix | *When I select Library for a Button's* [*icon mode*](../blocks-toolbox/common-properties.md#icon)*, there is no spacing between the Icon's image and description in the dropdown.*<br>Padding was added between the Icon's image and description for accessibility. |
| Fix | *My* [*Indicator label*](../blocks-toolbox/basic/indicator.md#label) *only shows if the X-Axis and Y-Axis position is configured - even though the visibility is set to "On Hover" or "Always".*<br>The Indicator label visibility of Never, On Hover, and Always work as expected.<br>This fix applies to newly added blocks. For indicator blocks added before v4.4.5, change the position in advanced styling from static to relative. |
| Fix | The v4.4.4 change to move the edit pencil, visible to designers on an App at runtime, was reverted to its original position. |

## Data Stream Designer

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | *I've filled out my data stream's* [*business case*](../how-tos/data-streams/use-business-case-and-notes.md#adding-a-business-case)*, but I get an error 'Unable to save business case changes' when trying to save it.*<br>A red outline has been added to indicate that the business use case text is a required input. |

## Subscription Manager

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Fix | *Users who have registered, but have not yet been approved by an administrator, can be added to a product subscription.*<br>Only approved users are available for selection to add to a product subscription. |

## Stream Host

| Change Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Enhancement | Python-capable [Docker Stream Host images](../installation/complete-installation/install-stream-host/docker.md#image-flavors) were added for Ubuntu and Alpine - and Python was removed from the default Stream Host images to keep them lightweight. |
