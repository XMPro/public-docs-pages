# Configure SSO (Optional)

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials. XMPro supports SSO integration with various identity providers, making it easier for users to access the platform while maintaining security.

## Available SSO Options

XMPro supports the following SSO options:

- [SSO with Azure AD](sso-azure-ad.md) - Configure Single Sign-On using Microsoft Azure Active Directory
- [SSO with ADFS](sso-adfs.md) - Configure Single Sign-On using Active Directory Federation Services

Choose the appropriate SSO option based on your organization's identity management infrastructure. Implementing SSO can simplify user access management and enhance security by centralizing authentication.
