# Agents

An Agent is a reusable object which forms the building block of a [Data Stream](../../concepts/data-stream/). When a number of Agents are connected together, a Data Stream is formed.

Each Agent is designed to perform a specific function in the stream. For example, they can be used to retrieve data from a database in real-time, display data, filter, sort the data, or save the data somewhere else, depending on the function of that individual Agent.
