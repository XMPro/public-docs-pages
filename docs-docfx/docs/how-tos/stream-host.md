# Stream Host

A Stream Host is an application that can either be installed as a Docker container, a Windows Service, or a Console Application. Stream Hosts enable Data Streams to run and execute actions and are also responsible for getting the configurations of [Non-Virtual Agents](../concepts/agent/virtual-vs-non-virtual-agents.md#non-virtual-agents).

## How to Install a Stream Host

The recommended Stream Host deployment is as a Docker container - see the [Docker](../installation/3.-complete-installation/install-stream-host/docker.md) instructions.

Alternate methods can be found at [Install Stream Host](../installation/3.-complete-installation/install-stream-host/).

## How to Override Variables

Although each Stream Host in a given Collection downloads the same definition of a Data Stream, the [Variables](manage-variables.md) defined in Data Stream Designer can be overridden by the individual Stream Host to provide the unique configuration e.g. per Asset, site, or OPC IP Address.

The options to override variables for a Stream Host are:

* [Using Environment Variables](stream-host.md#using-environment-variables) - enables the scalable and efficient creation of multiple Docker Stream Hosts through scripting.
* [Using Variables.xv files](stream-host.md#using-variables.xv-file) - requires manual edits for each Stream Host.

In practice you'd use one or the other, but it may be helpful that the Stream Host&#x20;

The Stream Host retrieves variable values in the following order:

1. Environment Variable, if no match then...
2. Variables.xv File, if no match then...
3. Variables (i.e. as detailed in [Using a Variable](../concepts/variable.md#using-a-variable))

### Using Environment Variables

_v4.4.2_

This option can be applied to any Stream Host install scenario, although it is better suited for when running [Stream Host on Docker](../installation/3.-complete-installation/install-stream-host/docker.md).

Create an environment variable that is applied to a running Stream Host instance, prefixing the name of the variable that should be overridden with `xmvariable__`

```
xmvariable__NameOfVariable1=foo
xmvariable__NameOfVariable2=bar
xmvariable__NameOfVariable3=noop
```

### Using Variables.xv files

> [!NOTE]
> This option is not supported when running Stream Host on Docker.

1. Open the Collection page.
2. Select the Collection.
3. Hover on More.
4. Click Variables.
5. Click Select file and upload the encrypted variables.xv file, found in the Data folder of the Stream Host's installation directory e.g. "_C:\Program Files\XMPro Stream Host\Data_".
6. You can enter overrides for any Variables.
7. Click Download to get the updated file.
8. Replace the original file in your Stream Host folder with the new one.
9. Restart your Stream Host to load the updated variables.
