# Setup Input Mappings

Input Mappings allow you to specify that an Agent receives its input in a specific structure. This is possible by configuring the arrows between the two Agents, which allow the user to map the inputs of the Agent to incoming attributes.&#x20;

This functionality is beneficial if you want to map any incoming data from a preceding Agent to specific attributes that can be saved in rows or columns in a database using an Action Agent, such as an SQL Server Writer.

## Adding Input Mappings

To add Input Mappings between two Agents, follow the steps below:

1. Click on the arrow between the two Agents you want to map.
2. Click on _Configure_. The left side lists all the properties the first Agent is sending. The right side is listing all the inputs the receiving Agent is expecting.
3. Select the property you want to map for each field. If the value is greyed out, it means it does not match the type (number, text, etc) that the receiving Agent is expecting for that field.
