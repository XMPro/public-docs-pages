# Data Streams

A Data Stream allows you to view the flow of data between [Agents](../../concepts/agent/), which are connected using arrows that allow data to flow from one Agent to the next. This allows you to view data from multiple Data Sources in one place, and complete certain actions on the data such as aggregating, filtering, displaying, or re-saving the data into another database.
