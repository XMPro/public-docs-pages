# Admin Unpublish Override

The Admin Unpublish Override feature allows administrators to unpublish XMPro assets that were published by other users. This is particularly useful in situations where the original publisher is unavailable or when administrative action is required to manage published assets.

## Who Can Use This Feature

This feature is available only to users with administrative privileges in XMPro. Specifically, users must have:

- Administrator role
- Access to the specific asset type (Data Stream, Recommendation, or Application)

## How to Use Admin Unpublish Override

1. Navigate to the asset you want to unpublish (Data Stream, Recommendation, or Application).
2. Select the published version of the asset.
3. Click on the **Unpublish** button.
4. A confirmation dialog will appear, indicating that you are unpublishing an asset published by another user.
5. Confirm the action to unpublish the asset.

## Important Considerations

When using the Admin Unpublish Override feature, keep the following in mind:

- **Audit Trail**: All unpublish actions performed by administrators are logged in the system audit trail, including the original publisher and the administrator who performed the unpublish action.
- **Notifications**: The original publisher will receive a notification that their asset has been unpublished by an administrator.
- **Impact**: Unpublishing an asset will make it unavailable to end users and may impact any dependent systems or processes.
- **Republishing**: After unpublishing, the asset can be modified and republished by users with appropriate permissions.

## Best Practices

- **Communication**: Before unpublishing an asset published by another user, it's recommended to communicate with the original publisher if possible.
- **Documentation**: Document the reason for unpublishing in the asset's notes or in a separate tracking system.
- **Coordination**: Coordinate with stakeholders who might be affected by the unpublishing of the asset.
- **Timing**: Consider the timing of unpublishing to minimize disruption to users and dependent systems.
