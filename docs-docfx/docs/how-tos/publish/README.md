# Publish

Publishing will finalize the XMPro asset and make it available for all users with Run Access. To configure the run access and who can see the asset once it is published, visit [How to Manage Access](../manage-access.md). Versions of XMPro Objects that are already published cannot be edited or deleted by any user, and must be unpublished before they can be edited. Only one version of an XMPro Object can be published at a time.
