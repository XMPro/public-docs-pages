# Publish

Publishing will finalize the XMPro asset and make it available for all users with Run Access. To configure the run access and who can see the asset once it is published, visit [How to Manage Access](../manage-access.md). Versions of XMPro Objects that are already published cannot be edited or deleted by any user, and must be unpublished before they can be edited. Only one version of an XMPro Object can be published at a time.

## How to Unpublish

2. Click on _Unpublish._

> [!NOTE]
> You can unpublish an XMPro Object even if you are currently viewing another version. The Unpublish button will only be available if any version of that XMPro Object is currently published. Clicking the button will unpublish the version that is published.
