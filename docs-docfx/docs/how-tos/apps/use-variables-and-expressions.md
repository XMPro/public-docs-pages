# Use Variables & Expressions

Variables are placeholders used to hold and maintain certain values. In some cases, it is possible to not know some of the values that you might want to display or use within the Application. In this case, you can use Variables where the real value can be substituted in later. Expressions can also be configured and are useful for doing certain calculations and returning results which can also be used in the Application.&#x20;

## Adding Expressions

When adding a Variable, there is an option to build an expression. The example below shows an expression that multiplies the values of two variables together. To build an expression, follow the steps below:

1. Change the mode to _expression_.
2. Select the expression box.
3. Select from a range of parameters, Variables, and other functions to build an expression. When a value is selected it will appear in the expression box.

Numbers are identified as integers by default. Convert to other data types using:&#x20;

* a method e.g.`ToLong(0)`for the value 0 as a long
* `2.0`for the value 2 as a double
