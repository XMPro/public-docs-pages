When a new Page is created, they are automatically configured to have links going back to the landing page, which can be seen at the top of the screen.

## Navigating Using Back URL

You can include a back URL to the current page when configuring a Navigate To URL, so that the user can return to the original page. For example, you want to open an Alert from a custom templated list and the alert drill-down needs a back URL.&#x20;

To append a back URL, follow these steps:

1. Click on _Block Properties_.
2. Under '_Action_', click on the _Navigate To_ Dropdown and select _URL_.
3. Toggle the URL mode to Expression Mode.
4. Click the dropdown to edit the expression value.

```
