# Use Flex

Flex styles are a way of changing the layout of the page so it is responsive. When using Flex, the layout and position of the Blocks will respond to fit the screen, which is important in ensuring that users have a good user experience regardless of the screen size they are viewing your Application on.

## Blocks inside the Flex Container

### Grow

Grow will grow the item to fit the container.

If multiple Blocks have a grow value greater than 0, they will take up a ratio of the available space.

### Shrink

Shrink determines whether an item is allowed to shrink if the screen is too small or if other Blocks take up too much space. Shrink will not work if the Block has a minimum width or height.
