## How To Manage Apps

Each card on the Categories dashboard shows the Name, Description, and Icon of the Category, as well as the number of Unpublished and Published Apps in the category.

Clicking on the Applications button in the menu will take you to the Applications list. The Applications list is grouped by Category. Apps that have the play icon are Published.

Click on a row to view an App, or click on an edit button to edit an App. The edit button will only be shown for Apps that you have edit access to.

Clicking on a Category on the App Designer Categories dashboard will take you to the Applications dashboard for that Category. Each card shows the Icon, Name, and Description of the App as well as how many users have access, the version, the time and date it was last modified, the owner's profile picture and name, and whether the App is Published - if so it will have "Active" in green, and if not it will have "Draft" in yellow.

### Importing an App with Data Stream Connections

When importing an App with Data Stream Connections, there is an option to map all of the App's connections to their corresponding Data Stream version and Agent.

This step can be skipped during the import, but each App Page's data source will have to be updated individually.
