# Widgets

Widgets in XMPro App Designer are custom, reusable components that can be created by combining existing blocks and functionality. They provide a way to encapsulate complex UI patterns and functionality into reusable components that can be shared across your applications.

## Understanding Widgets

Widgets are similar to Metablocks but are managed at the application level rather than at the page level. They allow you to create custom components that can be reused across multiple pages and applications, promoting consistency and reducing development time.

Widgets can contain any combination of blocks, including layout blocks, basic blocks, visualizations, and even other widgets. They can also include custom logic, data bindings, and styling.

## Creating Widgets

To create a widget:

1. Design the component using standard blocks in the App Designer
2. Select all the blocks that make up the component
3. Right-click and select "Create Widget"
4. Provide a name and description for the widget
5. Configure the widget properties and data bindings
6. Save the widget

Once created, the widget will be available in the Widgets section of the Toolbox and can be used like any other block.

## Managing Widgets

Widgets can be managed through the Widget Manager, which allows you to:

- View all available widgets
- Edit existing widgets
- Create new widgets
- Delete widgets
- Export widgets for sharing
- Import widgets from other sources

To access the Widget Manager, click on the "Widgets" button in the App Designer toolbar.

## Best Practices for Using Widgets

1. **Design for reusability**: When creating widgets, design them to be as reusable as possible. Use parameters and properties to make them configurable for different use cases.

2. **Document your widgets**: Provide clear documentation for your widgets, including their purpose, configuration options, and usage examples. This will help other users understand how to use them effectively.

3. **Use consistent naming conventions**: Adopt consistent naming conventions for your widgets to make them easy to find and understand.

4. **Group related functionality**: Create widgets that encapsulate related functionality to promote modularity and maintainability.

5. **Test thoroughly**: Test your widgets thoroughly in different contexts to ensure they work as expected in all scenarios.

6. **Consider performance**: Be mindful of the performance implications of your widgets, especially if they include complex logic or data operations.

7. **Maintain version control**: Keep track of widget versions and changes to ensure compatibility and facilitate updates.

## Examples of Common Widgets

- Trend indicator
- Action buttons

### Filter Panel Widget

A widget that provides a standardized interface for filtering data, including:

- Text search
- Date range selection
- Category filters
- Apply/Reset buttons

### Chart with Legend Widget

A widget that combines a chart with a customizable legend and additional controls, including:

- Chart component
- Interactive legend
- Time period selector

### Form Section Widget

A widget that provides a standardized form section with consistent styling and behavior, including:

- Section title
- Form fields
- Validation
- Help text

## Sharing Widgets

Widgets can be shared across your organization to promote consistency and reduce duplication of effort. To share a widget:

1. Export the widget from the Widget Manager
2. Share the exported widget file with other users
3. Other users can import the widget through their Widget Manager

By effectively using widgets, you can create a library of reusable components that enhance productivity, maintain consistency, and reduce development time across your XMPro applications.
