# Actions Blocks

Actions blocks in XMPro App Designer enable user interactions and trigger functionality within your applications. These blocks allow users to navigate between pages, submit forms, execute operations, and interact with data sources.

## Available Actions Blocks

- [Box Hyperlink](box-hyperlink.md) - A container that acts as a clickable hyperlink
- [Button](button.md) - A standard button control for triggering actions
- [Data Operations](data-operations.md) - A block for performing operations on data sources
- [Hyperlink](hyperlink.md) - A text-based hyperlink for navigation

## Best Practices for Using Actions Blocks

1. **Use clear and descriptive labels**: Ensure that action labels clearly communicate what will happen when the user interacts with them. For example, use "Save" instead of "OK" for a button that saves a form.

2. **Provide visual feedback**: Use visual cues to indicate when an action is being processed or has been completed. This helps users understand the status of their interactions.

3. **Consider placement and visibility**: Position action blocks where users expect to find them and ensure they are easily visible. Follow standard UI patterns, such as placing primary actions on the right and secondary actions on the left.

4. **Implement appropriate validation**: Before executing actions that modify data or navigate away from a page, ensure that appropriate validation is performed to prevent data loss or invalid operations.

5. **Handle errors gracefully**: When actions encounter errors, provide clear and helpful error messages that guide users on how to resolve the issue.

6. **Optimize for performance**: Actions should be responsive and execute quickly. If an action requires significant processing time, provide feedback to the user and consider using asynchronous processing.

7. **Consider accessibility**: Ensure that action blocks are accessible to all users, including those using screen readers or keyboard navigation. Use appropriate ARIA attributes and ensure keyboard focus is managed correctly.
