#### Common Properties

The _Disabled_ property is common to most Blocks. The _Disabled_ property is only available for the Data Operations Block if the _Display Mode_ property is set to 'Button';

[See the Common Properties article for more details on common behavior properties.](../common-properties.md#behavior)

#### Mode

There are two modes that you can choose from: Insert and Delete. The Mode determines what operation will be performed on the Data Source and records.

'Insert' will add a new row to the list:

'Delete' will delete a record from the list:

> [!NOTE]
> When a record is inserted or deleted, it does not immediately update the Data Source. To do this, you will need to add a regular Button with 'Update Data Sources' selected.
> 
> [See the Common Properties article for more details on common action properties.](../common-properties.md#action)

#### Data Source

The Data Source that you would like to add a new record to. This is only available if the Mode property is set to 'Insert'.

If the Mode property is set to 'Insert', the Data Source property is required for the Data Operations Block.

#### Enable Focus

This determines if the user can navigate to the Button by using the keyboard. This includes using the tab button to switch between text boxes on a form, and then clicking the tab button at the end to highlight and select the Button. Buttons will also be focused on when you click on them. If a Button is clicked, and no action occurs, the Button will also remain in focus.

This is only available if the Display Mode property is set to 'Button'.

#### Show Confirmation Dialog

This can either be set to 'True' or 'False'. If True, a dialog box will appear asking the user if they are sure they want to delete that particular record.

This is only available if the Mode property is set to 'Delete'.
