### Data

#### Display

The Display property is required for the Tree List.&#x20;

**Id**

The Id property is required for the Tree List.&#x20;

#### Parent Id

Properties include the _Parent Id_ so the component knows how the fields are connected to each other. The Parent Id refers to the Id of the parent record. For example, in the hierarchy of employees, multiple people could report to one manager, so their parent Ids would be the Id of the person they are listed underneath. If the parent Id of a record is set to null or 0, it will automatically be placed as a root or main parent element on the tree. &#x20;
