# Html Editor

The HTML Editor allows the user to create notes and style them. Styling includes changing the font, size, font-weight, or heading style of the text. The user can also add bullet points, numbered lists, images, quotes, links to websites, and more. This is useful if you would like the user to have an area where they can write and save notes.
