# Recommendations Blocks

Recommendations blocks in XMPro App Designer provide powerful tools for managing and interacting with the XMPro Recommendations system. These blocks enable you to display, analyze, and respond to alerts and recommendations generated by your applications.

## Available Recommendations Blocks

- [Alert Action](alert-action.md) - Enables users to take actions on alerts
- [Alert Analytics](recommendation-analytics.md) - Provides analytical insights into alert data
- [Alert Discussion](recommendation-alert-discussion.md) - Facilitates discussions around alerts
- [Alert Event Data](alert-event-data.md) - Displays the event data associated with an alert
- [Alert Form](recommendation-form.md) - Presents forms for capturing information related to alerts
- [Alert List](recommendations.md) - Displays a list of alerts
- [Alert Timeline](alert-timeline.md) - Shows the timeline of events for an alert
- [Alert Triage](alert-triage.md) - Supports the triage process for alerts
- [Alert Survey](alert-survey.md) - Collects feedback about alerts
- [Recommendation Chart](recommendation-chart.md) - Visualizes recommendation data

## Best Practices for Using Recommendations Blocks

1. **Design for clarity**: Ensure that alerts and recommendations are presented clearly and with sufficient context for users to understand their significance and take appropriate action.

2. **Prioritize effectively**: Use visual cues and sorting to help users identify the most critical alerts that require immediate attention.

3. **Provide actionable information**: Include relevant details and context with each alert to help users make informed decisions about how to respond.

4. **Enable efficient workflows**: Design your recommendation interfaces to support efficient workflows for reviewing, triaging, and responding to alerts.

5. **Capture resolution information**: Use Alert Forms and Alert Discussions to capture information about how alerts were resolved, which can be valuable for future reference and process improvement.

6. **Analyze patterns**: Use Alert Analytics and Recommendation Charts to identify patterns and trends in your alert data, which can help you address underlying issues.

7. **Integrate with other systems**: Consider how your recommendation system integrates with other business systems and processes to ensure a cohesive approach to managing alerts.
