# Alert Action

Configure a button to perform one of the following [actions](../../concepts/recommendation/recommendation-alert.md#actions) on an open Recommendation Alert:

* Mark As Resolved
* Mark As False Positive
* Save
* Share
* Assign

The button text - and in some cases the icon - are defaulted when the [action](#action) property is selected, but the designer can override these properties.

The action button will be disabled at run-time should the alert be archived.

#### Enable Focus

This determines if the user can navigate to the Button by using the keyboard. This includes using the tab button to switch between text boxes on a form, and then clicking the tab button at the end to highlight and select the Button. Buttons will also be focused on when you click on them. If a Button is clicked, and no action occurs, the Button will also remain in focus.
