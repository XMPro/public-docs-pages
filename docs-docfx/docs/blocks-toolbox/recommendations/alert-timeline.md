# Alert Timeline

A list of the activities that have occurred on an Alert.

If this list includes a hyperlink for an escalated alert, configuration properties allow the designer to determine the behavior of that hyperlink. Perhaps the design is for all alerts to be shown using the same Page, or use a formula to show archived alerts on a different Page in the same or a different App (use the URL option to accomplish this).
