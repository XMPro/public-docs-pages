## Best Practices for Using Layout Blocks

1. **Start with the right layout structure**: Choose the appropriate layout blocks based on the content you need to display and the user experience you want to create.

2. **Use nesting effectively**: Layout blocks can be nested within each other to create complex layouts. Use this capability judiciously to avoid overly complex structures.

3. **Consider responsiveness**: Use layout blocks that adapt well to different screen sizes, especially if your application will be used on mobile devices.

4. **Maintain consistency**: Use similar layout patterns throughout your application to provide a consistent user experience.

5. **Use appropriate spacing**: Pay attention to margins and padding to ensure that your content is well-spaced and easy to read.

6. **Group related content**: Use layout blocks to group related content together, making it easier for users to understand the relationships between different pieces of information.

7. **Optimize for performance**: Avoid excessive nesting of layout blocks, as this can impact performance, especially on mobile devices.
