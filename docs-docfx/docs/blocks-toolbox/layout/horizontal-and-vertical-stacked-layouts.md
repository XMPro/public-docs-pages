# Stacked Layout Horizontal & Vertical

Horizontal Stacked Layouts separate a given area into columns. Vertical Stacked Layouts separate a given layout into rows. Columns or rows can be added or reduced to change the layout. This Block can be useful if the position of the page contents needs to be displayed right-to-left or top-to-bottom.
