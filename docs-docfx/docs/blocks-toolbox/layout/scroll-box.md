# Scroll Box

The Scroll Box is a box that will create scrollbars if the content is larger than the box. In order for the scrollbar to work properly, the containing element must not have a display value of flex. This is useful if you have lots of content that cannot fit in one area of the webpage, but you would still like the user to view all the content.
