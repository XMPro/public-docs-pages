# AI Blocks

AI blocks in XMPro App Designer provide powerful artificial intelligence capabilities that can be integrated directly into your applications. These blocks leverage advanced AI technologies to enhance your applications with intelligent features such as natural language processing, content generation, and contextual assistance.

## Available AI Blocks

- [Azure Copilot](azure-copilot.md) - AI assistant powered by Microsoft Azure AI services
- [ChatGPT Copilot](chatgpt-copilot.md) - AI assistant powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT technology

## Best Practices for Using AI Blocks

1. **Define clear use cases**: Identify specific use cases where AI can add value to your application. AI blocks are most effective when they address well-defined problems or enhance specific user experiences.

2. **Set appropriate expectations**: Communicate clearly to users about the capabilities and limitations of AI features in your application. This helps manage user expectations and builds trust.

3. **Provide context**: AI models perform better when given appropriate context. Design your application to provide relevant context to AI blocks, such as user history, current task, or domain-specific information.

4. **Implement user feedback mechanisms**: Allow users to provide feedback on AI-generated content or suggestions. This feedback can help improve the AI's performance over time and identify areas for improvement.

5. **Consider privacy and security**: Be mindful of the data being sent to AI services. Ensure that sensitive information is handled appropriately and in compliance with relevant regulations.

6. **Design for graceful degradation**: Ensure that your application can still function effectively if AI services are unavailable or if responses don't meet expectations.

7. **Monitor and evaluate performance**: Regularly monitor the performance of AI blocks in your application. Track metrics such as accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction to identify opportunities for improvement.
