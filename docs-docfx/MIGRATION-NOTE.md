# Image Verification and Navigation Fix Tools

The essential tools needed to complete the image verification process and fix navigation issues in the XMPro documentation have been moved to the `migration-docs` folder. Unnecessary migration files have been backed up to keep the directory focused on the current tasks.

## Current Issues

The original image verification script was causing token limit issues when run with AI assistance. The optimized scripts in the migration-docs folder address this issue by using minimal memory and storing only essential information.

## Available Tools

The following tools are available in the migration-docs folder:

### Navigation Fix Tools
- Scripts to identify and fix navigation issues
- Tools to verify navigation functionality

### Image Verification Tools
- Optimized image verification scripts
- Progress and report files

Please see the [migration-docs/README.md](migration-docs/README.md) file for a complete overview of the available tools and how to use them.
